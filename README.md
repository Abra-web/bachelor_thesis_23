# Readme file
The only modification that has to be made if you want to run the files: 
- version1_simple.ipynb
- version2_predefined_dictionary.ipynb

Is to modify the "my_path" variable found in those files. You 
basically just have to replace that variable with your own project path
directive. This variable can be found under the "Pipeline" title.
