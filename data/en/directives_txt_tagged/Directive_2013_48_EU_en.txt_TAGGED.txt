[directive](448) [directive](448) 2013/48/eu of the [euro](665) [parliament](2242) and of the council
of 22 october 2013
on the [rights of access](7352) to a lawyer in [criminal proceedings](5415) and in [euro](665) [arrest](3970) [war](1210) proceedings, and on the right to have a third party informed upon deprivation of liberty and to
communicate with third persons and with consular authorities while deprived of liberty
necessary approximation of [legislation](1589) would facilitate
cooperation between competent authorities and the
judicial protection of individual rights.

the [euro](665) [parliament](2242) and the [Council of Europe](121) union,

having regard to the treaty on the functioning of the [euro](665) union, and in particular point (b) of [arts](2688) 82(2) thereof,
having regard to the proposal from the [euro](665) commission,

(3)

pursuant to [arts](2688) 82(1) of the treaty on the func­
tioning of the [euro](665) union (tfeu), ‘[judicial cooperation](217) in criminal matters in the union shall be
based on the principle of mutual recognition of
judgments and judicial [decision](348) ’.

(4)

the implementation of the principle of mutual recog­
nition of [decision](348) in criminal matters presupposes that
member [State](883) [trust](4574) in each other’s criminal justice
systems. the extent of the mutual recognition is very
much dependent on a number of parameters, which
include mechanisms for safeguarding the rights of
suspects or accused persons and common minimum
[standard](2077) necessary to facilitate the application of the
principle of mutual recognition.

(5)

although the member [State](883) are party to the echr and
to the iccpr, experience has shown that that alone does
not always provide a sufficient degree of [trust](4574) in the
criminal justice systems of other member [State](883) 

(6)

mutual recognition of [decision](348) in criminal matters can
operate effectively only in a [spirits](601) of [trust](4574) in which not
only judicial authorities, but all actors in the criminal
process consider [decision](348) of the judicial authorities of
other member [State](883) as equivalent to their own, implying
not only [trust](4574) in the adequacy of other member [State](883) 
rules, but also [trust](4574) that those rules are correctly applied.
strengthening mutual [trust](4574) requires detailed rules on the
protection of the procedural rights and [guarantee](1129) arising
from the charter, the echr and the iccpr. it also
requires, by means of this [directive](448) and by means of
other measures, further development within the union
of the minimum [standard](2077) set out in the charter and
in the echr.

after transmission of the draft legislative act to the [national](3521) [parliament](2242) 
having regard to the [opinion](4449) of the [euro](665) economic and
social committee (1),

fundamental freedoms (the echr) and [arts](2688) 14 of
the international covenant on civil and [[political rights](3900) (582) (the iccpr) enshrine the right to a fair trial. [arts](2688) 48(2)
of the charter [guarantee](1129) respect for the [rights of the defence](3974) 
the union has set itself the objective of maintaining and
developing an area of freedom, [securities](4646) and justice.
according to the presidency conclusions of the
[euro](665) council in tampere of 15 and 16 october
1999, and in particular point (33) thereof, the principle
of mutual recognition of judgments and other [decision](348) of judicial authorities should become the cornerstone of
[judicial cooperation](217) in civil and criminal matters within
the union because enhanced mutual recognition and the

[Official Journal](1533) of the [euro](665) union

[arts](2688) 82(2) tfeu provides for the [establishment](871) of
minimum rules applicable in the member [State](883) so as
to facilitate mutual recognition of judgments and
judicial [decision](348) and [police](2440) and [judicial cooperation](217) in
criminal matters having a cross-border dimension. that
[arts](2688) refers to ‘the rights of individuals in [criminal procedure](2704)  as one of the areas in which minimum rules
may be established.

(8)

common minimum rules should [lead](2428) to increased
confidence in the criminal justice systems of all
member [State](883)  which, in turn, should [lead](2428) to more
efficient [judicial cooperation](217) in a [climate](6011) of mutual
[trust](4574) and to the [promotion](2807) of a fundamental rights
[culture](317) in the union. such common minimum rules
should also remove obstacles to the free movement of
citizens throughout the territory of the member [State](883) 
such common minimum rules should be established in
relation to the [rights of access](7352) to a lawyer in [criminal proceedings](5415)  the right to have a third party informed
upon deprivation of liberty and the right to communicate
with third persons and with consular authorities while
deprived of liberty.

(9)

on 30 november 2009, the council adopted a
[resolution](3470) on a roadmap for strengthening the
procedural rights of suspected or accused persons in
[criminal proceedings](5415) (‘the roadmap’) (1). taking a stepby-step approach, the roadmap calls for the adoption of
measures regarding the right to [translation](4478) and interpre­
tation (measure a), the [right to information](513) (1422) on rights
and [information](1422) about the [charge](4882) (measure b), the
right to legal advice and legal [AIDS](5172) (measure c), the
right to communicate with relatives, [employer](735) and
consular authorities (measure d), and special safeguards
for suspects or accused persons who are vulnerable
(measure e). the roadmap emphasises that the order
of the rights is only indicative and thus implies that it
may be changed in accordance with priorities. the
roadmap is designed to operate as a whole; only when
all its components are implemented will its benefits be
felt in full.

(10)

(11)

on 11 december 2009, the [euro](665) council welcomed
the roadmap and made it part of the [stock](4280) programme — an open and secure [euro](665) serving and
protecting citizens (2) (point 2.4). the [euro](665) council
underlined the non-exhaustive character of the roadmap,
by inviting the commission to examine further elements
of minimum procedural rights for suspects and accused
persons, and to assess whether other issues, for instance
the presumption of innocence, need to be addressed, in
order to promote better cooperation in that area.
two measures have been adopted pursuant to the
roadmap to date, namely [directive](448) 2010/64/eu of the
[euro](665) [parliament](2242) and of the council of 20 october
2010 on the right to interpretation and [translation](4478) in

the [euro](665) [parliament](2242) and of the council of 22 may
2012 on the [right to information](513) (1422) in criminal proceed­
ings (4).
(12)

this [directive](448) lays down minimum rules concerning the
[rights of access](7352) to a lawyer in [criminal proceedings](5415) and in
proceedings for the execution of a [euro](665) [arrest](3970) [war](1210) pursuant to council [framework decision](7194) (348) 2002/584/jha of 13 june 2002 on the [euro](665) [arrest](3970) [war](1210) and the surrender procedures between
member [State](883) (5) ([euro](665) [arrest](3970) [war](1210) proceedings)
and the right to have a third party informed upon depri­
[VAT](4585) of liberty and to communicate with third persons
and with consular authorities while deprived of liberty. in
doing so, it promotes the application of the charter, in
particular [arts](2688) 4, 6, 7, 47 and 48 thereof, by [building](4831) upon [arts](2688) 3, 5, 6 and 8 echr, as interpreted by the
[euro](665) court of [human rights](584)  which, in its [case-law](1550) 
on an ongoing basis, sets [standard](2077) on the [rights of access](7352) to a lawyer. that [case-law](1550) provides, inter alia, that the
fairness of proceedings requires that a suspect or accused
person be able to obtain the whole range of [service](4099) specifically associated with legal assistance. in that
regard, the lawyers of suspects or accused persons
should be able to secure without restriction, the funda­
mental aspects of the defence.

(13)

without prejudice to the obligations of member [State](883) under the echr to ensure the right to a fair trial,
proceedings in relation to minor offending which take
place within a prison and proceedings in relation to
[offence](1432) committed in a military context which are
dealt with by a commanding officer should not be
considered to be [criminal proceedings](5415) for the purposes
of this [directive](448) 

(14)

this [directive](448) should be implemented taking into
[account](61) the [provision](3446) of [directive](448) 2012/13/eu, which
provide that suspects or accused persons are provided
promptly with [information](1422) concerning the [rights of access](7352) to a lawyer, and that suspects or accused
persons who are [arrest](3970) or detained are provided
promptly with a written letter of rights containing
[information](1422) about the [rights of access](7352) to a lawyer.

(15)

the term ‘lawyer’ in this [directive](448) refers to any person
who, in accordance with [national](3521) law, is qualified and
entitled, including by means of accreditation by an auth­
orised body, to provide legal advice and assistance to
suspects or accused persons.

(16)

in some member [State](883) an authority other than a court
having [jurisdiction](42) in criminal matters has competence
for imposing sanctions other than deprivation of liberty
in relation to relatively minor [offence](1432)  that may be the
case, for example, in relation to [traffic offence](7944) (1432) which are
committed on a large scale and which might be estab­
lished following a [traffic control](3107)  in such situations, it
would be unreasonable to require that the competent

authorities ensure all the rights under this [directive](448) 
where the law of a member [State](883) provides for the
imposition of a sanction regarding minor [offence](1432) by
such an authority and there is either a right of [appeal](5954) or the possibility for the case to be otherwise referred to
a court having [jurisdiction](42) in criminal matters, this
[directive](448) should therefore apply only to the proceedings
before that court following such an [appeal](5954) or referral.

(17)

in some member [State](883) certain minor [offence](1432)  in
particular minor [traffic offence](7944) (1432)  minor [offence](1432) in
relation to general municipal [regulation](3099) and minor
[public order](2162) [offence](1432)  are considered to be criminal
[offence](1432)  in such situations, it would be unreasonable
to require that the competent authorities ensure all the
rights under this [directive](448)  where the law of a member
[State](883) provides in respect of minor [offence](1432) that depri­
[VAT](4585) of liberty cannot be imposed as a sanction, this
[directive](448) should therefore apply only to the proceedings
before a court having [jurisdiction](42) in criminal matters.

(18)

the scope of application of this [directive](448) in respect of
certain minor [offence](1432) should not affect the obligations
of member [State](883) under the echr to ensure the right to
a fair trial including obtaining legal assistance from a
lawyer.

(19)

member [State](883) should ensure that suspects or accused
persons have the [rights of access](7352) to a lawyer without
undue delay in accordance with this [directive](448)  in any
event, suspects or accused persons should be granted
access to a lawyer during [criminal proceedings](5415) before a
court, if they have not waived that right.

(20)

for the purposes of this [directive](448)  questioning does not
include preliminary questioning by the [police](2440) or by
another law enforcement authority the purpose of
which is to identify the person concerned, to verify the
possession of weapons or other similar safety issues or to
determine whether an investigation should be started, for
example in the course of a road-side check, or during
regular random checks when a suspect or accused person
has not yet been identified.

(21)

where a person other than a suspect or accused person,
such as a witness, becomes a suspect or accused person,
that person should be protected against self-incrimination
and has the right to remain silent, as confirmed by the
[case-law](1550) of the [euro](665) court of [human rights](584)  this
[directive](448) therefore makes express reference to the
practical situation where such a person becomes a
suspect or accused person during questioning by the
[police](2440) or by another law enforcement authority in the
context of [criminal proceedings](5415)  where, in the course of
such questioning, a person other than a suspect or
accused person becomes a suspect or accused person,

l 294/3

questioning should be suspended immediately. however,
questioning may be continued if the person concerned
has been made aware that he or she is a suspect or
accused person and is able to fully exercise the rights
provided for in this [directive](448) 

(22)

suspects or accused persons should have the right to
meet in private with the lawyer representing them.
member [State](883) may make practical arrangements
concerning the duration and frequency of such
meetings, taking into [account](61) the circumstances of the
proceedings, in particular the complexity of the case and
the procedural steps applicable. member [State](883) may also
make practical arrangements to ensure safety and
[securities](4646)  in particular of the lawyer and of the suspect
or accused person, in the place where such a meeting is
conducted. such practical arrangements should not
prejudice the effective exercise or essence of the right
of suspects or accused persons to meet their lawyer.

(23)

suspects or accused persons should have the right to
communicate with the lawyer representing them. such
communication may take place at any stage, including
before any exercise of the right to meet that lawyer.
member [State](883) may make practical arrangements
concerning the duration, frequency and [means of communication](2012)  including concerning the use of video­
conferencing and other communication [technology](4415) in
order to allow such communications to take place.
such practical arrangements should not prejudice the
effective exercise or essence of the right of suspects or
accused persons to communicate with their lawyer.

(24)

in respect of certain minor [offence](1432)  this [directive](448) should
not prevent member [State](883) from organising the right of
suspects or accused persons to have access to a lawyer by
[telephone](4431)  however, limiting the right in this way should
be restricted to cases where a suspect or accused person
will not be questioned by the [police](2440) or by another law
enforcement authority.

(25)

member [State](883) should ensure that suspects or accused
persons have the right for their lawyer to be present
and participate effectively when they are questioned by
the [police](2440) or by another law enforcement or judicial
authority, including during court hearings. such partici­
pation should be in accordance with any procedures
under [national](3521) law which may regulate the participation
of a lawyer during questioning of the suspect or accused
person by the [police](2440) or by another law enforcement or
judicial authority, including during court hearings,
provided that such procedures do not prejudice the
effective exercise and essence of the right concerned.
during questioning by the [police](2440) or by another law

enforcement or judicial authority of the suspect or
accused person or in a court hearing, the lawyer may,
inter alia, in accordance with such procedures, ask ques­
tions, request clarification and make [State](883)  which
should be [record](3871) in accordance with [national](3521) law.

(28)

suspects or accused persons have the right for their
lawyer to attend investigative or [evidence](4434) gathering
acts, insofar as they are provided for in the [national](3521) law concerned and in so far as the suspects or accused
persons are required or permitted to attend. such acts
should at least include identity parades, at which the
suspect or accused person figures among other persons
in order to be identified by a [victim](4695) or witness; confron­
tations, where a suspect or accused person is brought
together with one or more witnesses or [victim](4695) where
there is disagreement between them on [import](1309) facts
or issues; and reconstructions of the scene of a [crime](3348) in
the presence of the suspect or accused person, in order
to better understand the [man](5281) and circumstances
under which a [crime](3348) was committed and to be able to
ask specific questions to the suspect or accused person.
member [State](883) may make practical arrangements
concerning the presence of a lawyer during investigative
or [evidence](4434) gathering acts. such practical arrangements
should not prejudice the effective exercise and essence of
the rights concerned. where the lawyer is present during
an investigative or [evidence](4434) gathering act, this should be
noted using the [record](3871) procedure in accordance with
the law of the member [State](883) concerned.

member [State](883) should endeavour to make general
[information](1422) available, for instance on a website or by
means of a leaflet that is available at [police](2440) stations, to
facilitate the obtaining of a lawyer by suspects or accused
persons. however, member [State](883) would not need to take
active steps to ensure that suspects or accused persons
who are not deprived of liberty will be assisted by a
lawyer if they have not themselves arranged to be
assisted by a lawyer. the suspect or accused person
concerned should be able freely to contact, consult and
be assisted by a lawyer.

where suspects or accused persons are deprived of
liberty, member [State](883) should make the necessary
arrangements to ensure that such persons are in a
position to exercise effectively the [rights of access](7352) to a
lawyer, including by arranging for the assistance of a
lawyer when the person concerned does not have one,
unless they have waived that right. such arrangements
could imply, inter alia, that the competent authorities

6.11.2013

(29)

the conditions in which suspects or accused persons are
deprived of liberty should fully respect the [standard](2077) set
out in the echr, in the charter, and in the [case-law](1550) of
the court of justice of the [euro](665) union (the court of
justice) and of the [euro](665) court of [human rights](584) 
when providing assistance under this [directive](448) to a
suspect or to an accused person who is deprived of
liberty, the lawyer concerned should be able to raise a
question with the competent authorities regarding the
conditions in which that person is deprived of liberty.

(30)

in cases of geographical remoteness of the suspect or
accused person, such as in overseas territories or where
the member [State](883) undertakes or participates in military
operations outside its territory, member [State](883) are
permitted to derogate temporarily from the right of the
suspect or accused person to have access to a lawyer
without undue delay after deprivation of liberty. during
such a temporary derogation, the competent authorities
should not question the person concerned or carry out
any of the investigative or [evidence](4434) gathering acts
provided for in this [directive](448)  where immediate access
to a lawyer is not possible because of the geographical
remoteness of the suspect or accused person, member
[State](883) should arrange for communication via [telephone](4431) or video conference unless this is impossible.

(31)

member [State](883) should be permitted to derogate
temporarily from the [rights of access](7352) to a lawyer in the
pre-trial phase when there is a need, in cases of urgency,
to avert serious adverse consequences for the life, liberty
or physical integrity of a person. during a temporary
derogation on that ground, the competent authorities
may question suspects or accused persons without the
lawyer being present, provided that they have been
informed of their right to remain silent and can
exercise that right, and provided that such questioning
does not prejudice the [rights of the defence](3974)  including the
[privilege](3049) against self-incrimination. questioning may be
carried out for the sole purpose and to the extent
necessary to obtain [information](1422) that is essential to
avert serious adverse consequences for the life, liberty
or physical integrity of a person. any abuse of this
derogation would in principle irretrievably prejudice the
[rights of the defence](3974)

[Official Journal](1533) of the [EU Member State](5283) should also be permitted to derogate
temporarily from the [rights of access](7352) to a lawyer in the
pre-trial phase where immediate action by the investi­
[GATS](6115) authorities is imperative to prevent substantial
jeopardy to [criminal proceedings](5415)  in particular to
prevent destruction or alteration of essential [evidence](4434) 
or to prevent [interference](1436) with witnesses. during a
temporary derogation on that ground, the competent
authorities may question suspects or accused persons
without a lawyer being present, provided that they
have been informed of their right to remain silent and
can exercise that right, and provided that such ques­
tioning does not prejudice the [rights of the defence](3974) 
including the [privilege](3049) against self-incrimination. ques­
tioning may be carried out for the sole purpose and to
the extent necessary to obtain [information](1422) that is
essential to prevent substantial jeopardy to [criminal proceedings](5415)  any abuse of this derogation would in
principle irretrievably prejudice the [rights of the defence](3974) 

[confidentiality](92) of communication between suspects or
accused persons and their lawyer is key to ensuring the
effective exercise of the [rights of the defence](3974) and is an
essential part of the right to a fair trial. member [State](883) should therefore respect the [confidentiality](92) of meetings
and other [form](1076) of communication between the lawyer
and the suspect or accused person in the exercise of the
[rights of access](7352) to a lawyer provided for in this [directive](448) 
without derogation. this [directive](448) is without prejudice to
procedures that address the situation where there are
objective and factual circumstances giving rise to the
suspicion that the lawyer is involved with the suspect
or accused person in a criminal [offence](1432)  any criminal
activity on the part of a lawyer should not be considered
to be legitimate assistance to suspects or accused persons
within the framework of this [directive](448)  the obligation to
respect [confidentiality](92) not only implies that member
[State](883) should refrain from interfering with or accessing
such communication but also that, where suspects or
accused persons are deprived of liberty or otherwise
find themselves in a place under the control of the
[State](883)  member [State](883) should ensure that arrangements
for communication uphold and protect [confidentiality](92) 
this is without prejudice to any mechanisms that are
in place in detention facilities with the purpose of
avoiding illicit enclosures being sent to detainees, such
as [screen](5601) [correspondence](242)  provided that such mech­
anisms do not allow the competent authorities to read
the communication between suspects or accused persons
and their lawyer. this [directive](448) is also without prejudice
to procedures under [national](3521) law according to which
forwarding [correspondence](242) may be rejected if the
sender does not agree to the [correspondence](242) first being
submitted to a competent court.

this [directive](448) should be without prejudice to a breach of
[confidentiality](92) which is incidental to a lawful [surveillance](5144) 
l 294/5

operation by competent authorities. this [directive](448) should
also be without prejudice to the [work](4543) that is carried out,
for example, by [national](3521) intelligence [service](4099) to safeguard
[national](3521) [securities](4646) in accordance with [arts](2688) 4(2) of the
treaty on [euro](665) union (teu) or that falls within the
scope of [arts](2688) 72 tfeu, pursuant to which title v on
an area of freedom, [securities](4646) and justice must not affect
the exercise of the responsibilities incumbent upon
member [State](883) with regard to the [maintenance](831) of law
and order and the safeguarding of internal [securities](4646) 

(35)

suspects or accused persons who are deprived of liberty
should have the right to have at least one person, such as
a relative or an [employer](735)  nominated by them, informed
of their deprivation of liberty without undue delay,
provided that this does not prejudice the due course of
the [criminal proceedings](5415) against the person concerned or
any other [criminal proceedings](5415)  member [State](883) may
make practical arrangements in relation to the appli­
cation of that right. such practical arrangements should
not prejudice the effective exercise and essence of the
right. in limited, exceptional circumstances, however, it
should be possible to derogate temporarily from that
right when this is justified, in the light of the particular
circumstances of the case, by a compelling reason as
specified in this [directive](448)  when the competent auth­
orities envisage making such a temporary derogation in
respect of a specific third person, they should firstly
consider whether another third person, nominated by
the suspect or accused person, could be informed of
the deprivation of liberty.

(36)

suspects or accused persons should, while deprived of
liberty, have the right to communicate without undue
delay with at least one third person, such as a relative,
nominated by them. member [State](883) may limit or defer
the exercise of that right in view of imperative
requirements or proportionate operational requirements.
such requirements could include, inter alia, the need to
avert serious adverse consequences for the life, liberty or
physical integrity of a person, the need to prevent
prejudice to [criminal proceedings](5415)  the need to prevent
a criminal [offence](1432)  the need to await a court hearing,
and the need to protect [victim](4695) of [crime](3348)  when the
competent authorities envisage limiting or deferring the
exercise of the right to communicate in respect of a
specific third person, they should first consider whether
the suspects or accused persons could communicate with
another third person nominated by them. member [State](883) may make practical arrangements concerning the timing,

clarification and make [State](883)  the fact that the
lawyer has participated in such a hearing should be
noted using the [record](3871) procedure in accordance
with the law of the member [State](883) concerned.

the right of suspects and accused persons who are
deprived of liberty to consular assistance is enshrined
in [arts](2688) 36 of the 1963 [Vienna](6202) convention on
consular relations where it is a right conferred on
[State](883) to have access to their [national](3521)  this [directive](448) confers a corresponding right on suspects or accused
persons who are deprived of liberty, subject to their
wishes. consular protection may be exercised by
[diploma](446) authorities where such authorities act as
consular authorities.

requested persons should have the right to meet in
private with the lawyer representing them in the
executing member [State](883)  member [State](883) may make
practical arrangements concerning the duration and
frequency of such meetings, taking into [account](61) the
particular circumstances of the case. member [State](883) may also make practical arrangements to ensure safety
and [securities](4646)  in particular of the lawyer and of the
requested person, in the place where the meeting
between the lawyer and the requested person is
conducted. such practical arrangements should not
prejudice the effective exercise and essence of the right
of requested persons to meet with their lawyer.

(44)

requested persons should have the right to communicate
with the lawyer representing them in the executing
member [State](883)  it should be possible for such communi­
cation to take place at any stage, including before any
exercise of the right to meet with the lawyer. member
[State](883) may make practical arrangements concerning the
duration, frequency and [means of communication](2012) between requested persons and their lawyer, including
concerning the use of videoconferencing and other
communication [technology](4415) in order to allow such
communications to take place. such practical
arrangements should not prejudice the effective exercise
and essence of the right of requested persons to
communicate with their lawyer.

(45)

executing member [State](883) should make the necessary
arrangements to ensure that requested persons are in a
position to exercise effectively their [rights of access](7352) to a
lawyer in the executing member [State](883)  including by
arranging for the assistance of a lawyer when requested
persons do not have one, unless they have waived that
right. such arrangements, including those on legal [AIDS](5172) if
applicable, should be governed by [national](3521) law. they
could imply, inter alia, that the competent authorities
arrange for the assistance of a lawyer on the basis of a
list of available lawyers from which requested persons
could choose.

(46)

without undue delay after being informed that a
requested person wishes to appoint a lawyer in the
issuing member [State](883)  the competent authority of that
member [State](883) should provide the requested person with

member [State](883) should clearly set out in their [national](3521) law
the grounds and criteria for any temporary derogations
from the rights granted under this [directive](448)  and they
should make restricted use of those temporary deroga­
tions. any such temporary derogations should be
proportional, should be strictly limited in time, should
not be based exclusively on the type or the seriousness of
the alleged [offence](1432)  and should not prejudice the overall
fairness of the proceedings. member [State](883) should ensure
that where a temporary derogation has been authorised
under this [directive](448) by a judicial authority which is not a
[judge](1537) or a court, the [decision](348) on authorising the
temporary derogation can be assessed by a court, at
least during the trial stage.

(39)

suspects or accused persons should be able to waive a
right granted under this [directive](448) provided that they have
been given [information](1422) about the content of the right
concerned and the possible consequences of waiving that
right. when providing such [information](1422)  the specific
conditions of the suspects or accused persons
concerned should be taken into [account](61)  including their
age and their mental and physical condition.

(40)

a waiver and the circumstances in which it was given
should be noted using the [record](3871) procedure in
accordance with the law of the member [State](883) concerned.
this should not [lead](2428) to any additional obligation for
member [State](883) to introduce new mechanisms or to any
additional administrative burden.

(41)

where a suspect or accused person revokes a waiver in
accordance with this [directive](448)  it should not be necessary
to proceed again with questioning or any procedural acts
that have been carried out during the period when the
right concerned was waived.

(42)

persons subject to a [euro](665) [arrest](3970) [war](1210) (‘requested
persons’) should have the [rights of access](7352) to a lawyer in
the executing member [State](883) in order to allow them to
exercise their rights effectively under [framework decision](7194) (348) 2002/584/jha. where a lawyer participates in a hearing

include a current list of lawyers, or the name of a lawyer
on duty in the issuing [State](883)  who can provide
[information](1422) and advice in [euro](665) [arrest](3970) [war](1210) cases. member [State](883) could request that the appropriate

the surrender procedure is crucial for cooperation in
criminal matters between the member [State](883)  observance
of the time-limits contained in [framework decision](7194) (348) 2002/584/jha is essential for such cooperation.
therefore, while requested persons should be able to
exercise fully their rights under this [directive](448) in
[euro](665) [arrest](3970) [war](1210) proceedings, those time-limits
should be respected.

(51)

the duty of care towards suspects or accused persons
who are in a potentially weak position underpins a fair
administration of justice. the prosecution, law
enforcement and judicial authorities should therefore
facilitate the effective exercise by such persons of the
rights provided for in this [directive](448)  for example by
taking into [account](61) any potential vulnerability that
affects their ability to exercise the [rights of access](7352) to a
lawyer and to have a third party informed upon depri­
[VAT](4585) of liberty, and by taking appropriate steps to
ensure those rights are [guarantee](1129) 

(52)

this [directive](448) upholds the fundamental rights and prin­
ciples recognised by the charter, including the
prohibition of [torture](4467) and inhuman and degrading
treatment, the right to liberty and [securities](4646)  respect for
private and [family](965) life, the right to the integrity of the
person, the rights of the [child](758)  integration of persons
with disabilities, the right to an effective remedy and
the right to a fair trial, the presumption of innocence
and the [rights of the defence](3974)  this [directive](448) should be
implemented in accordance with those rights and prin­
ciples.

(53)

member [State](883) should ensure that the [provision](3446) of this
[directive](448)  where they correspond to rights [guarantee](1129) by
the echr, are implemented consistently with those of
the echr and as developed by [case-law](1550) of the
[euro](665) court of [human rights](584) 

(54)

this [directive](448) sets minimum rules. member [State](883) may
extend the rights set out in this [directive](448) in order to
provide a higher level of protection. such higher level
of protection should not constitute an obstacle to the
mutual recognition of judicial [decision](348) that those
minimum rules are designed to facilitate. the level of
protection should never fall below the [standard](2077) provided by the charter or by the echr, as interpreted
by the [case-law](1550) of the court of justice and of the
[euro](665) court of [human rights](584) 

(55)

this [directive](448) promotes the rights of [child](758) and takes
into [account](61) the [guide](5311) of the [Council of Europe](121) on
[child](758) friendly justice, in particular its [provision](3446) on
[information](1422) and advice to be given to [child](758)  this
[directive](448) ensures that suspects and accused persons,
including [child](758)  are provided with adequate
[information](1422) to understand the consequences of waiving
a right under this [directive](448) and that any such waiver is
made voluntarily and unequivocally. where the suspect
or accused person is a [child](758)  the holder of [parental responsibility](3316) should be notified as soon as possible
after the [child](758) s deprivation of liberty and should be
provided with the reasons therefor. if providing such
[information](1422) to the holder of [parental responsibility](3316) is
contrary to the best [interest](1476) of the [child](758)  another
suitable [adult](160) such as a relative should be informed
instead. this should be without prejudice to [provision](3446) 
pending a legislative act of the union on legal [AIDS](5172) 
member [State](883) should apply their [national](3521) law in
relation to legal [AIDS](5172)  which should be in line with the
charter, the echr and the [case-law](1550) of the [euro](665) court of [human rights](584) 

in accordance with the principle of effectiveness of
union law, member [State](883) should put in place
adequate and effective remedies to protect the rights
that are conferred upon individuals by this [directive](448) 

member [State](883) should ensure that in the [assessment](184) of
[State](883) made by suspects or accused persons or of
[evidence](4434) obtained in breach of their right to a lawyer, or
in cases where a derogation from that right was auth­
orised in accordance with this [directive](448)  the [rights of the defence](3974) and the fairness of the proceedings are respected.
in this context, regard should be had to the [case-law](1550) of
the [euro](665) court of [human rights](584)  which has estab­
lished that the [rights of the defence](3974) will, in principle, be
irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating [State](883) made during [police](2440) interrogation without access to a
lawyer are used for a conviction. this should be
without prejudice to the use of [State](883) for other
purposes permitted under [national](3521) law, such as the
need to execute urgent investigative acts to avoid the
perpetration of other [offence](1432) or serious adverse
consequences for any person or related to an urgent
need to prevent substantial jeopardy to [criminal proceedings](5415) where access to a lawyer or delaying the
investigation would irretrievably prejudice the ongoing
investigations regarding a serious [crime](3348)  further, this
should be without prejudice to [national](3521) rules or
systems regarding [admissibility](2913) of [evidence](4434)  and should
not prevent member [State](883) from maintaining a system
whereby all existing [evidence](4434) can be adduced before a
court or a [judge](1537)  without there being any separate or
prior [assessment](184) as to [admissibility](2913) of such [evidence](4434)

stances. where a deferral is applied the [child](758) should,

in accordance with the joint political declaration of
28 september 2011 of member [State](883) and the
commission on explanatory [document](486) (1), member
[State](883) have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases,
the notification of their transposition measures with one
or more [document](486) explaining the [relationship](2239) between
the components of a [directive](448) and the corresponding
parts of [national](3521) transposition instruments. with regard
to this [directive](448)  the legislator considers the transmission
of such [document](486) to be justified.

since the objectives of this [directive](448)  namely setting
common minimum rules for the [rights of access](7352) to a
lawyer in [criminal proceedings](5415) and in [euro](665) [arrest](3970) [war](1210) proceedings and the right to have a third
person informed of the deprivation of liberty and to
communicate with third persons and with consular auth­
orities while deprived of liberty, cannot be sufficiently
achieved by the member [State](883)  but can rather, by
reason of the scale of the measure, be better achieved
at union level, the union may adopt measures, in
accordance with the [principle of subsidiarity](5812) as set out
in [arts](2688) 5 teu. in accordance with the [principle of proportionality](6133)  as set out in that [arts](2688)  this [directive](448) does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve
those objectives.
