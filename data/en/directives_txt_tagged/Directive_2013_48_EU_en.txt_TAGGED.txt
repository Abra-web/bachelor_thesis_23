the [EURES](4054) [parliament](2242) and the [Council of Europe](121) union,

having regard to the treaty on the functioning of the [EURES](4054) union, and in particular point (b) of [arts](2688) 82(2) thereof,
having regard to the proposal from the [EURES](4054) commission,

(3)

pursuant to [arts](2688) 82(1) of the treaty on the func­
tioning of the [EURES](4054) union (tfeu), ‘[judicial cooperation](217) (227) in criminal matters in the union shall be
based on the principle of mutual recognition of
[judge](1537) and judicial [decision](348) ’.

(4)

the implementation of the principle of mutual recog­
nition of [decision](348) in criminal matters presupposes that
member [State](883) [trust](4574) in each other’s criminal justice
systems. the extent of the mutual recognition is very
much [dependant](5390) on a number of parameters, which
include [mechanisation](1848) for safeguarding the rights of
suspects or accused persons and common minimum
[standard](2077) necessary to facilitate the application of the
principle of mutual recognition.

(5)

although the member [State](883) are party to the echr and
to the iccpr, experience has shown that that alone does
not always provide a sufficient degree of [trust](4574) in the
criminal justice systems of other member [State](883) 

(6)

mutual recognition of [decision](348) in criminal matters can
operate effectively only in a [spirits](601) of [trust](4574) in which not
only judicial authorities, but all actors in the criminal
process consider [decision](348) of the judicial authorities of
other member [State](883) as equivalent to their own, implying
not only [trust](4574) in the adequacy of other member [State](883) 
[ruling](1538)  but also [trust](4574) that those [ruling](1538) are correctly applied.
strengthening mutual [trust](4574) requires detailed [ruling](1538) on the
[protectionism](2844) of the procedural rights and [guarantee](1129) arising
from the [chartering](254)  the echr and the iccpr. it also
requires, by means of this [directive](448) and by means of
other measures, further development within the union
of the minimum [standard](2077) set out in the [chartering](254) and
in the echr.

[arts](2688) 82(2) tfeu provides for the [establishment](871) of
minimum [ruling](1538) applicable in the member [State](883) so as
to facilitate mutual recognition of [judge](1537) and
judicial [decision](348) and [police](2440) and [judicial cooperation](217) (227) in
criminal matters having a cross-border dimension. that
[arts](2688) refers to ‘the rights of individuals in [criminal procedure](2704)  as one of the areas in which minimum [ruling](1538) may be [establishment](871) 

(8)

common minimum [ruling](1538) should [lead](2428) to increased
confidence in the criminal justice systems of all
member [State](883)  which, in turn, should [lead](2428) to more
efficient [judicial cooperation](217) (227) in a [climate](6011) of mutual
[trust](4574) and to the [promotion](2807) of a fundamental rights
[culture](317) in the union. such common minimum [ruling](1538) should also remove obstacles to the free movement of
citizens throughout the territory of the member [State](883) 
such common minimum [ruling](1538) should be [establishment](871) in
relation to the [rights of access](7352) to a lawyer in [criminal proceedings](5415)  the right to have a third party [information](1422) upon deprivation of [Liberalism](1614) and the right to communicate
with third persons and with [consulate](5535) authorities while

on 30 november 2009, the council adopted a
[resolution](3470) on a roadmap for strengthening the
procedural rights of suspected or accused persons in
[criminal proceedings](5415) (‘the roadmap’) (1). taking a stepby-step approach, the roadmap calls for the adoption of
measures regarding the right to [translation](4478) and interpre­
tation (measure a), the [right to information](513) (1422) on rights
and [information](1422) about the [charge](4882) (measure b), the
right to [legality](1588) advice and [legality](1588) [AIDS](5172) (measure c), the
right to communicate with relatives, [employer](735) and
[consulate](5535) authorities (measure d), and special safeguards
for suspects or accused persons who are vulnerable
(measure e). the roadmap emphasises that the order
of the rights is only indicative and thus implies that it
may be changed in accordance with priorities. the
roadmap is designed to operate as a whole; only when
all its components are implemented will its benefits be
felt in full.

(10)

(11)

on 11 december 2009, the [EURES](4054) council welcomed
the roadmap and made it part of the [stock](4280) programme — an open and [securities](4646) [EURES](4054) serving and
protecting citizens (2) (point 2.4). the [EURES](4054) council
underlined the non-exhaustive character of the roadmap,
by inviting the commission to [examination](925) further elements
of minimum procedural rights for suspects and accused
persons, and to [assessment](184) whether other issues, for instance
the presumption of innocence, need to be addressed, in
order to [promotion](2807) better [cooperative](227) in that area.
two measures have been adopted pursuant to the
roadmap to date, namely [directive](448) 2010/64/eu of the
[EURES](4054) [parliament](2242) and of the council of 20 october
2010 on the right to [interpreting](1482) and [translation](4478) in

the [EURES](4054) [parliament](2242) and of the council of 22 may
2012 on the [right to information](513) (1422) in [criminal proceedings](5415) 
ings (4).
(12)

this [directive](448) lays down minimum [ruling](1538) concerning the
[rights of access](7352) to a lawyer in [criminal proceedings](5415) and in
proceedings for the [executive](5080) of a [EURES](4054) [arrest](3970) [war](1210) pursuant to council [framework decision](7194) (348) 2002/584/jha of 13 june 2002 on the [EURES](4054) [arrest](3970) [war](1210) and the surrender procedures between
member [State](883) (5) ([EURES](4054) [arrest](3970) [war](1210) proceedings)
and the right to have a third party [information](1422) upon depri­
[VAT](4585) of [Liberalism](1614) and to communicate with third persons
and with [consulate](5535) authorities while deprived of [Liberalism](1614)  in
doing so, it [promotion](2807) the application of the [chartering](254)  in
particular [arts](2688) 4, 6, 7, 47 and 48 thereof, by [building](4831) upon [arts](2688) 3, 5, 6 and 8 echr, as [interpreting](1482) by the
[EURES](4054) court of [human rights](584)  which, in its [case-law](1550) 
on an ongoing basis, sets [standard](2077) on the [rights of access](7352) to a lawyer. that [case-law](1550) provides, inter alia, that the
fairness of proceedings requires that a suspect or accused
person be able to obtain the whole range of [service](4099) specifically [association](2944) with [legality](1588) [assistant  [V4.3]](8407) that
regard, the lawyers of suspects or accused persons
should be able to [securities](4646) without restriction, the funda­
mental aspects of the defence.

(13)

without prejudice to the obligations of member [State](883) under the echr to ensure the right to a fair trial,
proceedings in relation to minor offending which take
place within a [prisoner](3955) and proceedings in relation to
[offence](1432) committed in a [militarism](1931) context which are
dealt with by a commanding officer should not be
considered to be [criminal proceedings](5415) for the purposes
of this [directive](448) 

(14)

this [directive](448) should be implemented taking into
[[[accounting](54) (60) (61) the [provision](3446) of [directive](448) 2012/13/eu, which
provide that suspects or accused persons are provided
promptly with [information](1422) concerning the [rights of access](7352) to a lawyer, and that suspects or accused
persons who are [arrest](3970) or detained are provided
promptly with a written letter of rights [container](158) [information](1422) about the [rights of access](7352) to a lawyer.

(15)

the term ‘lawyer’ in this [directive](448) refers to any person
who, in accordance with [[[nationality](2034) (2033) (3521) law, is qualified and
entitled, including by means of accreditation by an auth­
orised body, to provide [legality](1588) advice and [assistant  [V4.3]](8407) suspects or accused persons.

(16)

in some member [State](883) an authority other than a court
having [jurisdiction](42) in criminal matters has competence
for imposing sanctions other than deprivation of [Liberalism](1614) in relation to relatively minor [offence](1432)  that may be the
case, for example, in relation to [traffic offence](7944) (1432) which are
committed on a large scale and which might be estab­
lished following a [traffic control](3107)  in such situations, it
would be unreasonable to require that the competent

authorities ensure all the rights under this [directive](448) 
where the law of a member [State](883) provides for the
imposition of a sanction regarding minor [offence](1432) by
such an authority and there is either a right of [appeal](5954) or the possibility for the case to be otherwise referred to
a court having [jurisdiction](42) in criminal matters, this
[directive](448) should therefore apply only to the proceedings
before that court following such an [appeal](5954) or referral.

(17)

in some member [State](883) certain minor [offence](1432)  in
particular minor [traffic offence](7944) (1432)  minor [offence](1432) in
relation to general [municipality](27) regulations and minor
[[publication](2859) order](2162) [offence](1432)  are considered to be criminal
[offence](1432)  in such situations, it would be unreasonable
to require that the competent authorities ensure all the
rights under this [directive](448)  where the law of a member
[State](883) provides in respect of minor [offence](1432) that depri­
[VAT](4585) of [Liberalism](1614) cannot be imposed as a sanction, this
[directive](448) should therefore apply only to the proceedings
before a court having [jurisdiction](42) in criminal matters.

(18)

the scope of application of this [directive](448) in respect of
certain minor [offence](1432) should not affect the obligations
of member [State](883) under the echr to ensure the right to
a fair trial including obtaining [legality](1588) [assistant  [V4.3]](8407) lawyer.

(19)

member [State](883) should ensure that suspects or accused
persons have the [rights of access](7352) to a lawyer without
undue delay in accordance with this [directive](448)  in any
event, suspects or accused persons should be granted
access to a lawyer during [criminal proceedings](5415) before a
court, if they have not waived that right.

(20)

for the purposes of this [directive](448)  questioning does not
include preliminary questioning by the [police](2440) or by
another law enforcement authority the purpose of
which is to identify the person concerned, to verify the
possession of weapons or other similar safety issues or to
determine whether an investigation should be started, for
example in the course of a road-side check, or during
[regulation](3099) random checks when a suspect or accused person
has not yet been identified.

(21)

where a person other than a suspect or accused person,
such as a witness, becomes a suspect or accused person,
that person should be protected against self-incrimination
and has the right to remain silent, as confirmed by the
[case-law](1550) of the [EURES](4054) court of [human rights](584)  this
[directive](448) therefore makes express reference to the
practical situation where such a person becomes a
suspect or accused person during questioning by the
[police](2440) or by another law enforcement authority in the
context of [criminal proceedings](5415)  where, in the course of
such questioning, a person other than a suspect or
accused person becomes a suspect or accused person,

l 294/3

questioning should be suspended immediately. however,
questioning may be continued if the person concerned
has been made aware that he or she is a suspect or
accused person and is able to fully exercise the rights
provided for in this [directive](448) 

(22)

suspects or accused persons should have the right to
meet in private with the lawyer representing them.
member [State](883) may make practical arrangements
concerning the duration and frequency of such
meetings, taking into [[[accounting](54) (60) (61) the circumstances of the
proceedings, in particular the complexity of the case and
the procedural steps applicable. member [State](883) may also
make practical arrangements to ensure safety and
[securities](4646)  in particular of the lawyer and of the suspect
or accused person, in the place where such a meeting is
conducted. such practical arrangements should not
prejudice the effective exercise or essence of the right
of suspects or accused persons to meet their lawyer.

(23)

suspects or accused persons should have the right to
communicate with the lawyer representing them. such
communication may take place at any stage, including
before any exercise of the right to meet that lawyer.
member [State](883) may make practical arrangements
concerning the duration, frequency and [means of communication](2012)  including concerning the use of video­
conferencing and other communication [technology](4415) in
order to allow such communications to take place.
such practical arrangements should not prejudice the
effective exercise or essence of the right of suspects or
accused persons to communicate with their lawyer.

(24)

in respect of certain minor [offence](1432)  this [directive](448) should
not prevent member [State](883) from [organisation](4189) the right of
suspects or accused persons to have access to a lawyer by
[telephone](4431)  however, limiting the right in this way should
be restricted to cases where a suspect or accused person
will not be questioned by the [police](2440) or by another law
enforcement authority.

(25)

member [State](883) should ensure that suspects or accused
persons have the right for their lawyer to be present
and participate effectively when they are questioned by
the [police](2440) or by another law enforcement or judicial
authority, including during court hearings. such partici­
pation should be in accordance with any procedures
under [[[nationality](2034) (2033) (3521) law which may [regulation](3099) the participation
of a lawyer during questioning of the suspect or accused
person by the [police](2440) or by another law enforcement or
judicial authority, including during court hearings,
provided that such procedures do not prejudice the
effective exercise and essence of the right concerned.

tions, request clarification and make [State](883)  which

suspects or accused persons have the right for their
lawyer to attend investigative or [evidence](4434) gathering
acts, insofar as they are provided for in the [[[nationality](2034) (2033) (3521) law concerned and in so far as the suspects or accused
persons are required or permitted to attend. such acts
should at [lease](4598) include identity parades, at which the
suspect or accused person figures among other persons
in order to be identified by a [victim](4695) or witness; confron­
tations, where a suspect or accused person is brought
together with one or more witnesses or [victim](4695) where
there is disagreement between them on [import](1309) facts
or issues; and reconstructions of the scene of a [crime](3348) in
the presence of the suspect or accused person, in order
to better understand the [man](5281) and circumstances
under which a [crime](3348) was committed and to be able to
ask specific questions to the suspect or accused person.
member [State](883) may make practical arrangements
concerning the presence of a lawyer during investigative
or [evidence](4434) gathering acts. such practical arrangements
should not prejudice the effective exercise and essence of
the rights concerned. where the lawyer is present during
an investigative or [evidence](4434) gathering act, this should be
noted using the [[recording](3873) (3871) procedure in accordance with
the law of the member [State](883) concerned.

member [State](883) should endeavour to make general
[information](1422) available, for instance on a website or by
means of a leaflet that is available at [police](2440) stations, to
facilitate the obtaining of a lawyer by suspects or accused
persons. however, member [State](883) would not need to take
active steps to ensure that suspects or accused persons
who are not deprived of [Liberalism](1614) will be [assistant  [V4.3]](8407) lawyer if they have not themselves arranged to be
[assistant  [V4.3]](8407) lawyer. the suspect or accused person
concerned should be able freely to contact, [consulate](5535) and
be [assistant  [V4.3]](8407) lawyer.

where suspects or accused persons are deprived of
[Liberalism](1614)  member [State](883) should make the necessary
arrangements to ensure that such persons are in a
position to exercise effectively the [rights of access](7352) to a
lawyer, including by arranging for the [assistant  [V4.3]](8407) lawyer when the person concerned does not have one,
unless they have waived that right. such arrangements
could imply, inter alia, that the competent authorities

(29)

the conditions in which suspects or accused persons are
deprived of [Liberalism](1614) should fully respect the [standard](2077) set
out in the echr, in the [chartering](254)  and in the [case-law](1550) of
the court of justice of the [EURES](4054) union (the court of
justice) and of the [EURES](4054) court of [human rights](584) 
when providing [assistant  [V4.3]](8407) [directive](448) to a
suspect or to an accused person who is deprived of
[Liberalism](1614)  the lawyer concerned should be able to raise a
question with the competent authorities regarding the
conditions in which that person is deprived of [Liberalism](1614) 

(30)

in cases of [geography](1148) remoteness of the suspect or
accused person, such as in [overseas territory](4451) or where
the member [State](883) undertakes or participates in [militarism](1931) operations outside its territory, member [State](883) are
permitted to derogate temporarily from the right of the
suspect or accused person to have access to a lawyer
without undue delay after deprivation of [Liberalism](1614)  during
such a temporary derogation, the competent authorities
should not question the person concerned or carry out
any of the investigative or [evidence](4434) gathering acts
provided for in this [directive](448)  where immediate access
to a lawyer is not possible because of the [geography](1148) remoteness of the suspect or accused person, member
[State](883) should arrange for communication via [telephone](4431) or video conference unless this is impossible.

(31)

member [State](883) should be permitted to derogate
temporarily from the [rights of access](7352) to a lawyer in the
pre-trial phase when there is a need, in cases of urgency,
to avert serious adverse consequences for the life, [Liberalism](1614) or physical integrity of a person. during a temporary
derogation on that ground, the competent authorities
may question suspects or accused persons without the
lawyer being present, provided that they have been
[information](1422) of their right to remain silent and can
exercise that right, and provided that such questioning
does not prejudice the [rights of the defence](3974)  including the
[privilege](3049) against self-incrimination. questioning may be
carried out for the sole purpose and to the extent
necessary to obtain [information](1422) that is essential to
avert serious adverse consequences for the life, [Liberalism](1614) or physical integrity of a person. any abuse of this
derogation would in principle irretrievably prejudice the
[rights of the defence](3974)

[Official Journal](1533) of the [EU Member State](5283) should also be permitted to derogate
temporarily from the [rights of access](7352) to a lawyer in the
pre-trial phase where immediate action by the [investment](1488) 
[GATS](6115) authorities is imperative to prevent substantial
jeopardy to [criminal proceedings](5415)  in particular to
prevent destruction or alteration of essential [evidence](4434) 
or to prevent [interference](1436) with witnesses. during a
temporary derogation on that ground, the competent
authorities may question suspects or accused persons
without a lawyer being present, provided that they
have been [information](1422) of their right to remain silent and
can exercise that right, and provided that such ques­
tioning does not prejudice the [rights of the defence](3974) 
including the [privilege](3049) against self-incrimination. ques­
tioning may be carried out for the sole purpose and to
the extent necessary to obtain [information](1422) that is

principle irretrievably prejudice the [rights of the defence](3974) 

[confidentiality](92) of communication between suspects or
accused persons and their lawyer is key to ensuring the
effective exercise of the [rights of the defence](3974) and is an
essential part of the right to a fair trial. member [State](883) should therefore respect the [confidentiality](92) of meetings
and other [form](1076) of communication between the lawyer
and the suspect or accused person in the exercise of the
[rights of access](7352) to a lawyer provided for in this [directive](448) 
without derogation. this [directive](448) is without prejudice to
procedures that address the situation where there are
objective and factual circumstances giving rise to the
suspicion that the lawyer is involved with the suspect
or accused person in a criminal [offence](1432)  any criminal
activity on the part of a lawyer should not be considered
to be legitimate [assistant  [V4.3]](8407) suspects or accused persons
within the framework of this [directive](448)  the obligation to
respect [confidentiality](92) not only implies that member
[State](883) should refrain from [interference](1436) with or accessing
such communication but also that, where suspects or
accused persons are deprived of [Liberalism](1614) or otherwise
find themselves in a place under the control of the

circumstances of the case, by a compelling reason as
specified in this [directive](448)  when the competent auth­

the exercise of that right in view of imperative
requirements or proportionate operational requirements.

tions. any such temporary derogations should be
proportional, should be strictly limited in time, should
not be based exclusively on the type or the seriousness of
the alleged [offence](1432)  and should not prejudice the overall
fairness of the proceedings. member [State](883) should ensure
that where a temporary derogation has been authorised
under this [directive](448) by a judicial authority which is not a
[judge](1537) or a court, the [decision](348) on authorising the
temporary derogation can be [assessment](184) by a court, at

been given [information](1422) about the content of the right
concerned and the possible consequences of waiving that
right. when providing such [information](1422)  the specific
conditions of the suspects or accused persons
concerned should be taken into [[[accounting](54) (60) (61)  including their
age and their mental and physical condition.

should be noted using the [[recording](3873) (3871) procedure in

should be respected.

(51)

the duty of care towards suspects or accused persons
who are in a potentially weak position underpins a fair
[administrator  [V4.3]](8542) justice. the prosecution, law
enforcement and judicial authorities should therefore
facilitate the effective exercise by such persons of the
rights provided for in this [directive](448)  for example by
taking into [[[accounting](54) (60) (61) any potential vulnerability that
affects their ability to exercise the [rights of access](7352) to a

[directive](448) ensures that suspects and accused persons,
including [child](758)  are provided with adequate
[information](1422) to understand the consequences of waiving
a right under this [directive](448) and that any such waiver is
made voluntarily and unequivocally. where the suspect
or accused person is a [child](758)  the holder of parental
responsibility should be notified as soon as possible
after the [child](758) s deprivation of [Liberalism](1614) and should be
provided with the reasons therefor. if providing such

contrary to the best [interest](1476) of the [child](758)  another
suitable [adult](160) such as a relative should be [information](1422) instead. this should be without prejudice to [provision](3446)

in this context, regard should be had to the [case-law](1550) of

shall have access to a lawyer from whichever of the following
points in time is the earliest:

notwithstanding [provision](3446) of [[[nationality](2034) (2033) (3521) law concerning the
mandatory presence of a lawyer, member [State](883) shall make
the necessary arrangements to ensure that suspects or accused
persons who are deprived of [Liberalism](1614) are in a position to exercise
effectively their [rights of access](7352) to a lawyer, unless they have
waived that right in accordance with [arts](2688) 9.

(a) before they are questioned by the [police](2440) or by another law
enforcement or judicial authority;
(b) upon the carrying out by investigating or other competent
authorities of an investigative or other [evidence](4434) gathering
