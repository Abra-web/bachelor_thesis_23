[directive](448) [directive](448) 2012/13/eu of the [EURES](4054) [parliament](2242) and of the council
of 22 may 2012
on the [right to information](513) (1422) in [criminal proceedings](5415) is ‘designed to strengthen [cooperative](227) between member
[State](883) but also to enhance the [protectionism](2844) of individual
rights’.

the [EURES](4054) [parliament](2242) and the [Council of Europe](121) union,

having regard to the treaty on the functioning of the [EURES](4054) union, and in particular [arts](2688) 82(2) thereof,

(3)

the implementation of the principle of mutual recog­
nition of [decision](348) in criminal matters presupposes that
member [State](883) [trust](4574) in each other’s criminal justice
systems. the extent of mutual recognition is very much
[dependant](5390) on a number of parameters, which include
[mechanisation](1848) for safeguarding the rights of suspects or
accused persons and common minimum [standard](2077) necessary to facilitate the application of the principle of
mutual recognition.

(4)

mutual recognition of [decision](348) in criminal matters can
operate effectively only in a [spirits](601) of [trust](4574) in which not
only judicial authorities but all actors in the criminal
process consider [decision](348) of the judicial authorities of
other member [State](883) as equivalent to their own, implying
not only [trust](4574) in the adequacy of other member [State](883) 
[ruling](1538)  but also [trust](4574) that those [ruling](1538) are correctly applied.

(5)

[arts](2688) 47 of the [chartering](254) of fundamental rights of the
[EURES](4054) union (hereinafter ‘the [chartering](254) ) and [arts](2688) 6
of the [EURES](4054) convention for the [protectionism](2844) of [human rights](584) and fundamental freedoms (hereinafter ‘the
echr’) enshrine the right to a fair trial. [arts](2688) 48(2)
of the [chartering](254) [guarantee](1129) respect for the [rights of the defence](3974) 

(6)

on 29 november 2000, the council, in accordance with
the tampere conclusions, adopted a programme of
measures to implement the principle of mutual recog­
nition of [decision](348) in criminal matters (3). the intro­
duction to the programme [State](883) that mutual recognition

[arts](2688) 6 of the [chartering](254) and [arts](2688) 5 echr enshrine the
right to [Liberalism](1614) and [securities](4646) of person. any restrictions
on that right must not exceed those permitted in
accordance with [arts](2688) 5 echr and inferred from the
[case-law](1550) of the [EURES](4054) court of [human rights](584) 

(7)

although all the member [State](883) are party to the echr,
experience has shown that that alone does not always
provide a sufficient degree of [trust](4574) in the criminal justice
systems of other member [State](883)

strengthening mutual [trust](4574) requires detailed [ruling](1538) on the
[protectionism](2844) of the procedural rights and [guarantee](1129) arising
from the [chartering](254) and from the echr.

having regard to the proposal from the [EURES](4054) commission,
after transmission of the draft [legislation](1589) act to the [[[nationality](2034) (2033) (3521) [parliament](2242) 
having regard to the [opinion](4449) of the [EURES](4054) [[economy](637) (3933) and
[socialism](4188) committee (1),
after [consulate](5535) the [Committee of the Regions](5508) 
acting in accordance with the [ordinance](2158) [legislation](1589) procedure (2),
whereas:
(1)

(2)

the union has set itself the objective of maintaining and
developing an area of freedom, [securities](4646) and justice.
according to the presidency conclusions of the
[EURES](4054) council in tampere of 15 and 16 october
1999, and in particular point 33 thereof, the principle
of mutual recognition of [judge](1537) and other [decision](348) of judicial authorities should become the cornerstone of
[judicial cooperation](217) (227) in both civil and criminal matters
within the union because enhanced mutual recognition
and the necessary approximation of [legislation](1589) would
facilitate [cooperative](227) between competent authorities
and the judicial [protectionism](2844) of individual rights.

[Official Journal](1533) of the [EURES](4054) union

[arts](2688) 82(2) of the treaty on the functioning of the
[EURES](4054) union provides for the [establishment](871) of
minimum [ruling](1538) applicable in the member [State](883) so as
to facilitate mutual recognition of [judge](1537) and
judicial [decision](348) and [police](2440) and [judicial cooperation](217) (227) in
criminal matters having a cross-border dimension. that
[arts](2688) refers to ‘the rights of individuals in [criminal procedure](2704)  as one of the areas in which minimum [ruling](1538) may be [establishment](871) 

(10)

common minimum [ruling](1538) should [lead](2428) to increased
confidence in the criminal justice systems of all
member [State](883)  which, in turn, should [lead](2428) to more
efficient [judicial cooperation](217) (227) in a [climate](6011) of mutual
[trust](4574)  such common minimum [ruling](1538) should be estab­
lished in the field of [information](1422) in [criminal proceedings](5415) 

(11)

on 30 november 2009, the council adopted a
[resolution](3470) on a roadmap for strengthening procedural
rights of suspected or accused persons in [criminal proceedings](5415) (1) (hereinafter ‘the roadmap’). taking a
step-by-step approach, the roadmap called for the
adoption of measures regarding the right to [translation](4478) and [interpreting](1482) (measure a), the [right to information](513) (1422) on rights and [information](1422) about the [charge](4882) (measure b),
the right to [legality](1588) advice and [legality](1588) [AIDS](5172) (measure c), the
right to communication with relatives, [employer](735) and
[consulate](5535) authorities (measure d), and special safeguards
for suspects or accused persons who are vulnerable
(measure e). the roadmap emphasises that the order
of the rights is only indicative and thus implies that it
may be changed in accordance with priorities. the
roadmap is designed to operate as a whole; only when
all its component parts have been implemented will its
benefits be felt in full.

(12)

on 11 december 2009, the [EURES](4054) council welcomed
the roadmap and made it part of the [stock](4280) programme — an open and [securities](4646) [EURES](4054) serving and
protecting citizens (2) (point 2.4). the [EURES](4054) council
underlined the non-exhaustive character of the roadmap,
by inviting the commission to [examination](925) further elements
of minimum procedural rights for suspects and accused
persons, and to [assessment](184) whether other issues, for instance
the presumption of innocence, need to be addressed, in
order to [promotion](2807) better [cooperative](227) in that area.

(13)

the first measure adopted pursuant to the roadmap,
measure a, was [directive](448) 2010/64/eu of the [EURES](4054) [parliament](2242) and of the council of 20 october 2010 on
the right to [interpreting](1482) and [translation](4478) in [criminal proceedings](5415) (3).

(14)

this [directive](448) relates to measure b of the roadmap. it
lays down common minimum [standard](2077) to be applied in
the field of [information](1422) about rights and about the
accusation to be given to persons suspected or accused
of having committed a criminal [offence](1432)  with a view to
enhancing mutual [trust](4574) among member [State](883)  this

[directive](448) [building](4831) on the rights laid down in the [chartering](254) 
and in particular [arts](2688) 6, 47 and 48 thereof, by
[building](4831) upon [arts](2688) 5 and 6 echr as [interpreting](1482) by
the [EURES](4054) court of [human rights](584)  in this [directive](448) 
the term ‘accusation’ is used to describe the same concept
as the term ‘[charge](4882)  used in [arts](2688) 6(1) echr.
(15)

in its communication of 20 april 2010 entitled
‘[delivery](1684) an area of freedom, [securities](4646) and justice for
[EURES](4054) s citizens — action [plan](7379) implementing the
[stock](4280) programme’, the commission announced
that it would present a proposal on the [right to information](513) (1422) on rights and [information](1422) about [charge](4882) in
2010.

(16)

this [directive](448) should apply to suspects and accused
persons regardless of their [[legality](1588) status](4274)  citizenship or
[[[nationality](2034) (2033) (3521) 

(17)

in some member [State](883) an authority other than a court
having [jurisdiction](42) in criminal matters has competence
for imposing sanctions in relation to relatively minor
[offence](1432)  that may be the case, for example, in relation
to [traffic offence](7944) (1432) which are committed on a large scale
and which might be [establishment](871) following a [traffic control](3107)  in such situations, it would be unreasonable to
require that the competent authority ensure all the rights
under this [directive](448)  where the law of a member [State](883) provides for the imposition of a sanction regarding
minor [offence](1432) by such an authority and there is either
a right of [appeal](5954) or the possibility for the case to be
otherwise referred to a court having [jurisdiction](42) in
criminal matters, this [directive](448) should therefore apply
only to the proceedings before that court following
such an [appeal](5954) or referral.

(18)

the [right to information](513) (1422) about procedural rights, which
is inferred from the [case-law](1550) of the [EURES](4054) court of
[human rights](584)  should be explicitly [establishment](871) by this
[directive](448) 

(19)

the competent authorities should [information](1422) suspects or
accused persons promptly of those rights, as they apply
under [[[nationality](2034) (2033) (3521) law, which are essential to safeguarding
the fairness of the proceedings, either orally or in writing,
as provided for by this [directive](448)  in order to allow the
practical and effective exercise of those rights, the
[information](1422) should be provided promptly in the course
of the proceedings and at the latest before the first
official interview of the suspect or accused person by
the [police](2440) or by another competent authority.

(20)

this [directive](448) lays down minimum [ruling](1538) with respect to
the [information](1422) on rights of suspects or accused persons.
this is without prejudice to [information](1422) to be given on
other procedural rights arising out of the [chartering](254)  the
echr, [[[nationality](2034) (2033) (3521) law and applicable union law as inter­
preted by the relevant [courts and tribunals](5691)  once the
[information](1422) about a particular right has been provided,
the competent authorities should not be required to

necessary to enable them to prepare their defence and
to safeguard the fairness of the proceedings.

reiterate it, unless the specific circumstances of the case
or the specific [ruling](1538) laid down in [[[nationality](2034) (2033) (3521) law so require.
(21)

references in this [directive](448) to suspects or accused
persons who are [arrest](3970) or detained should be
understood to refer to any situation where, in the
course of [criminal proceedings](5415)  suspects or accused
persons are deprived of [Liberalism](1614) within the meaning of
[arts](2688) 5(1)(c) echr, as [interpreting](1482) by the [case-law](1550) of
the [EURES](4054) court of [human rights](584) 

(22)

where suspects or accused persons are [arrest](3970) or
detained, [information](1422) about applicable procedural rights
should be given by means of a written letter of rights
drafted in an easily comprehensible [man](5281) so as to
[assistant  [V4.3]](8407) persons in understanding their rights. such
a letter of rights should be provided promptly to each
[arrest](3970) person when deprived of [Liberalism](1614) by the inter­
vention of law enforcement authorities in the context
of [criminal proceedings](5415)  it should include basic
[information](1422) concerning any possibility to [challenge  [V4.3]](8458) lawfulness of the [arrest](3970)  obtaining a review of the
detention, or requesting [provision](3446) release where, and
to the extent that, such a right exists in [[[nationality](2034) (2033) (3521) law.
to help member [State](883) draw up such a letter of rights, a
model is provided in annex i. that model is indicative
and may be subject to review in the context of the
commission’s [report](2891) on the implementation of this
[directive](448) and also once all the roadmap measures have
entered into force. the letter of rights may include other
relevant procedural rights that apply in member [State](883) 

(23)

(28)

the [information](1422) provided to suspects or accused persons
about the criminal act they are suspected or accused of
having committed should be given promptly, and at the
latest before their first official interview by the [police](2440) or
another competent authority, and without prejudicing
the course of ongoing investigations. a description of
the facts, including, where known, time and place,
relating to the criminal act that the persons are
suspected or accused of having committed and the
possible [legality](1588) classification of the alleged [offence](1432) should
be given in sufficient detail, taking into [[[accounting](54) (60) (61) the stage
of the [criminal proceedings](5415) when such a description is
given, to safeguard the fairness of the proceedings and
allow for an effective exercise of the [rights of the defence](3974) 

(29)

where, in the course of the [criminal proceedings](5415)  the
details of the accusation change to the extent that the
position of suspects or accused persons is substantially
affected, this should be communicated to them where
necessary to safeguard the fairness of the proceedings
and in due time to allow for an effective exercise of
the [rights of the defence](3974) 

(30)

[[documentation](494) (486) and, where appropriate, photographs, audio
and video [[recording](3873) (3871)  which are essential to [challenge  [V4.3]](8458) lawfulness of an [arrest](3970) or detention of
suspects or accused persons in accordance with
[[[nationality](2034) (2033) (3521) law, should be made available to suspects or
accused persons or to their lawyers at the latest before
a competent judicial authority is called to decide upon
the lawfulness of the [arrest](3970) or detention in accordance
with [arts](2688) 5(4) echr, and in due time to allow the
effective exercise of the right to [challenge  [V4.3]](8458) lawfulness
of the [arrest](3970) or detention.

(31)

for the purpose of this [directive](448)  access to the material
[evidence](4434)  as defined in [[[nationality](2034) (2033) (3521) law, whether for or
against the suspect or accused person, which is in the
possession of the competent authorities in relation to the
specific criminal case, should include access to materials
such as [[documentation](494) (486)  and where appropriate photographs
and audio and video [[recording](3873) (3871)  such materials may be
[container](158) in a case file or otherwise held by competent
authorities in any appropriate way in accordance with
[[[nationality](2034) (2033) (3521) law.

(32)

access to the material [evidence](4434) in the possession of the
competent authorities, whether for or against the suspect
or accused person, as provided for under this [directive](448) 
may be refused, in accordance with [[[nationality](2034) (2033) (3521) law, where
such access may [lead](2428) to a serious threat to the life or
fundamental rights of another person or where refusal of
such access is strictly necessary to safeguard an [import](1309) [publication](2859) [interest](1476)  any refusal of such access must be
weighed against the [rights of the defence](3974) of the suspect
or accused person, taking into [[[accounting](54) (60) (61) the different
stages of the [criminal proceedings](5415)  restrictions on such
access should be [interpreting](1482) strictly and in accordance

specific conditions and [ruling](1538) relating to the right of
suspects or accused persons to have another person
[information](1422) about their [arrest](3970) or detention are to be
determined by the member [State](883) in their [[[nationality](2034) (2033) (3521) law.
as set out in the roadmap, the exercise of that right
should not prejudice the due course of the [criminal proceedings](5415) 

(24)

this [directive](448) is without prejudice to the [provision](3446) of
[[[nationality](2034) (2033) (3521) law concerning safety of persons remaining in
detention facilities.

(25)

member [State](883) should ensure that, when providing
[information](1422) in accordance with this [directive](448)  suspects
or accused persons are provided, where necessary, with
[translation](4478) or [interpreting](1482) into a [language](1580) that they
understand, in accordance with the [standard](2077) set out in
[directive](448) 2010/64/eu.

(26)

when providing suspects or accused persons with
[information](1422) in accordance with this [directive](448) 
competent authorities should [pay](3843) particular attention to
persons who cannot understand the content or meaning
of the [information](1422)  for example because of their youth or
their mental or physical condition.

(27)

persons accused of having committed a criminal [offence](1432) should be given all the [information](1422) on the accusation

this [directive](448) respects fundamental rights and [[observer](5756) (6264) the principles recognised by the [chartering](254)  in particular,
this [directive](448) seeks to [promotion](2807) the right to [Liberalism](1614)  the

union level, the union may adopt measures in
accordance with the [principle of [subsidiary](998) (5812) as set out
in [arts](2688) 5 of the treaty on [EURES](4054) union. in
