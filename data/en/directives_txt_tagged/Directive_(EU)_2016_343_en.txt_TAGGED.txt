[directive](448) [directive](448) (eu) 2016/343 of the [euro](665) [parliament](2242) and of the council
of 9 [Marches](1813) 2016
on the strengthening of certain aspects of the presumption of innocence and of the right to be
present at the trial in [criminal proceedings](5415) the [euro](665) [parliament](2242) and the [Council of Europe](121) union,

having regard to the treaty on the functioning of the [euro](665) union, and in particular point (b) of [arts](2688) 82(2)
thereof,
having regard to the proposal from the [euro](665) commission,
after transmission of the draft legislative act to the [national](3521) [parliament](2242) 
having regard to the [opinion](4449) of the [euro](665) economic and social committee (1),
after consulting the [Committee of the Regions](5508) 
acting in accordance with the ordinary [legislative procedure](2702) (2),
whereas:
(1)

the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial are enshrined in [arts](2688) 47 and 48 of the charter of
fundamental rights of the [euro](665) union (the charter), [arts](2688) 6 of the [euro](665) convention for the
protection of [human rights](584) and fundamental freedoms (the echr), [arts](2688) 14 of the international covenant on
civil and [[political rights](3900) (582) (the iccpr) and [arts](2688) 11 of the universal declaration of [human rights](584) 

(2)

the union has set itself the objective of maintaining and developing an area of freedom, [securities](4646) and justice.
according to the presidency conclusions of the [euro](665) council in tampere of 15 and 16 october 1999, and
in particular point (33) thereof, enhanced mutual recognition of judgments and other judicial [decision](348) and the
necessary approximation of [legislation](1589) would facilitate cooperation between competent authorities and the
judicial protection of individual rights. the principle of mutual recognition should therefore become the
cornerstone of [judicial cooperation](217) in civil and criminal matters within the union.

(3)

according to the treaty on the functioning of the [euro](665) union (tfeu), [judicial cooperation](217) in criminal
matters in the union is to be based on the principle of mutual recognition of judgments and other judicial
[decision](348)

(4)

the implementation of that principle relies on the premise that member [State](883) [trust](4574) in each other's criminal
justice systems. the extent of the principle of mutual recognition is dependent on a number of parameters, which
include mechanisms for safeguarding the rights of suspects and accused persons and common minimum
[standard](2077) necessary to facilitate the application of that principle.

(5)

although the member [State](883) are party to the echr and to the iccpr, experience has shown that this in itself
does not always provide a sufficient degree of [trust](4574) in the criminal justice systems of other member [State](883) 

(6)

on 30 november 2009, the council adopted a [resolution](3470) on a roadmap for strengthening the procedural rights
of suspected or accused persons in [criminal proceedings](5415) (1) (‘the roadmap’). taking a step-by-step approach, the
roadmap calls for the adoption of measures regarding the right to [translation](4478) and interpretation (measure a), the
[right to information](513) (1422) on rights and [information](1422) about the [charge](4882) (measure b), the right to legal advice and legal
[AIDS](5172) (measure c), the right to communicate with relatives, [employer](735) and consular authorities (measure d), and
special safeguards for suspects or accused persons who are vulnerable (measure e).

(7)

on 11 december 2009, the [euro](665) council welcomed the roadmap and made it part of the [stock](4280) programme — an open and secure [euro](665) serving and protecting citizens (2) (point 2.4). the [euro](665) council
underlined the non-exhaustive character of the roadmap, by inviting the commission to examine further
elements of minimum procedural rights for suspects and accused persons, and to assess whether other issues, for
instance the presumption of innocence, need to be addressed, in order to promote better cooperation in that
area.

(8)

three measures on procedural rights in [criminal proceedings](5415) have been adopted pursuant to the roadmap to
date, namely [directive](448) 2010/64/eu (3), 2012/13/eu (4) and 2013/48/eu (5) of the [euro](665) [parliament](2242) and of
the council.

(9)

the purpose of this [directive](448) is to enhance the right to a fair trial in [criminal proceedings](5415) by laying down
common minimum rules concerning certain aspects of the presumption of innocence and the right to be present
at the trial.

(10)

by establishing common minimum rules on the protection of procedural rights of suspects and accused persons,
this [directive](448) aims to strengthen the [trust](4574) of member [State](883) in each other's criminal justice systems and thus to
facilitate mutual recognition of [decision](348) in criminal matters. such common minimum rules may also remove
obstacles to the free movement of citizens throughout the territory of the member [State](883) 

(11)

this [directive](448) should apply only to [criminal proceedings](5415) as interpreted by the court of justice of the
[euro](665) union (court of justice), without prejudice to the [case-law](1550) of the [euro](665) court of [human rights](584) 
this [directive](448) should not apply to [civil proceedings](5414) or to administrative proceedings, including where the latter
can [lead](2428) to sanctions, such as proceedings relating to [competition](75)  trade, [financial [service](4099)  [V4.3]](8469) traffic, [tax](1310) or [tax](1310) surcharges, and investigations by administrative authorities in relation to such proceedings.

(12)

this [directive](448) should apply to [natural person](2338) who are suspects or accused persons in [criminal proceedings](5415)  it
should apply from the moment when a person is suspected or accused of having committed a criminal [offence](1432) 
or an alleged criminal [offence](1432)  and, therefore, even before that person is made aware by the competent
authorities of a member [State](883)  by official notification or otherwise, that he or she is a suspect or accused person.
this [directive](448) should apply at all stages of the [criminal proceedings](5415) until the [decision](348) on the final determination
of whether the suspect or accused person has committed the criminal [offence](1432) has become definitive. [legal action](5371) and remedies which are available only once that [decision](348) has become definitive, including actions before
the [euro](665) court of [human rights](584)  should not fall within the scope of this [directive](448)

(13)

this [directive](448) acknowledges the different needs and levels of protection of certain aspects of the presumption of
innocence as regards natural and [legal person](2337)  as regards [natural person](2338)  such protection is reflected in wellestablished [case-law](1550) of the [euro](665) court of [human rights](584)  the court of justice has, however, recognised that
the rights flowing from the presumption of innocence do not accrue to [legal person](2337) in the same way as they do
to [natural person](2338) 

(14)

at the current stage of development of [national](3521) law and of [case-law](1550) at [national](3521) and union level, it is premature
to legislate at union level on the presumption of innocence with regard to [legal person](2337)  this [directive](448) should
not, therefore, apply to [legal person](2337)  this should be without prejudice to the application of the presumption of
innocence as laid down, in particular, in the echr and as interpreted by the [euro](665) court of [human rights](584) and by the court of justice, to [legal person](2337) 

(15)

the presumption of innocence with regard to [legal person](2337) should be ensured by the existing legislative
safeguards and [case-law](1550)  the evolution of which is to determine whether there is a need for union action.

(16)

the presumption of innocence would be violated if [public [State](883) (5568) made by public authorities, or judicial
[decision](348) other than those on guilt, referred to a suspect or an accused person as being guilty, for as long as that
person has not been proved guilty according to law. such [State](883) and judicial [decision](348) should not reflect an
[opinion](4449) that that person is guilty. this should be without prejudice to acts of the prosecution which aim to
prove the guilt of the suspect or accused person, such as the indictment, and without prejudice to judicial
[decision](348) as a result of which a suspended sentence takes effect, provided that the [rights of the defence](3974) are
respected. this should also be without prejudice to preliminary [decision](348) of a procedural nature, which are taken
by judicial or other competent authorities and are based on suspicion or on elements of incriminating [evidence](4434) 
such as [decision](348) on pre-trial detention, provided that such [decision](348) do not refer to the suspect or accused
person as being guilty. before taking a preliminary [decision](348) of a procedural nature the competent authority might
first have to verify that there are sufficient elements of incriminating [evidence](4434) against the suspect or accused
person to justify the [decision](348) concerned, and the [decision](348) could contain reference to those elements.

(17)

the term ‘[public [State](883) (5568) made by public authorities’ should be understood to be any [State](883) which refers
to a criminal [offence](1432) and which emanates from an authority involved in the [criminal proceedings](5415) concerning
that criminal [offence](1432)  such as judicial authorities, [police](2440) and other law enforcement authorities, or from another
[public authorities](2588)  such as [minister](1939) and other public officials, it being understood that this is without prejudice to
[national](3521) law regarding immunity.

(18)

the obligation not to refer to suspects or accused persons as being guilty should not prevent public authorities
from publicly disseminating [information](1422) on the [criminal proceedings](5415) where this is strictly necessary for reasons
relating to the criminal investigation, such as when video material is released and the public is asked to help in
identifying the alleged perpetrator of the criminal [offence](1432)  or to the public [interest](1476)  such as when, for safety
reasons, [information](1422) is provided to the inhabitants of an area affected by an alleged environmental [crime](3348) or
when the prosecution or another competent authority provides objective [information](1422) on the [State](883) of [criminal proceedings](5415) in order to prevent a [public order](2162) disturbance. the use of such reasons should be confined to
situations in which this would be reasonable and proportionate, taking all [interest](1476) into [account](61)  in any event,
the [man](5281) and context in which the [information](1422) is disseminated should not create the impression that the
person is guilty before he or she has been proved guilty according to law.

(19)

member [State](883) should take appropriate measures to ensure that, when they provide [information](1422) to the media,
public authorities do not refer to suspects or accused persons as being guilty for as long as such persons have
not been proved guilty according to law. to that end, member [State](883) should inform public authorities of the
[import](1309) of having due regard to the presumption of innocence when providing or divulging [information](1422) to
the media. this should be without prejudice to [national](3521) law protecting the freedom of [press](2599) and other media.

(20)

the competent authorities should abstain from presenting suspects or accused persons as being guilty, in court or
in public, through the use of measures of physical restraint, such as handcuffs, [glass](4676) boxes, cages and leg [iron](981) 
unless the use of such measures is required for case-specific reasons, either relating to [securities](4646)  including to
prevent suspects or accused persons from harming themselves or others or from damaging any property, or
relating to the prevention of suspects or accused persons from absconding or from having contact with third
persons, such as witnesses or [victim](4695)  the possibility of applying measures of physical restraint does not imply
that the competent authorities are to take any [form](1076) [decision](348) on the use of such measures.

l 65/4

[Official Journal](1533) of the [euro](665) union

(21)

where feasible, the competent authorities should also abstain from presenting suspects or accused persons in
court or in public while wearing prison clothes, so as to avoid giving the impression that those persons are
guilty.

(22)

the burden of [proof](5809) for establishing the guilt of suspects and accused persons is on the prosecution, and any
doubt should benefit the suspect or accused person. the presumption of innocence would be infringed if the
burden of [proof](5809) were shifted from the prosecution to the defence, without prejudice to any ex officio fact-finding
powers of the court, to the [independence of the judiciary](6623) when assessing the guilt of the suspect or accused
person, and to the use of presumptions of fact or law concerning the [criminal [liability](3497) (3513) of a suspect or accused
person. such presumptions should be confined within reasonable limits, taking into [account](61) the [import](1309) of
what is at stake and maintaining the [rights of the defence](3974)  and the means employed should be reasonably propor­
tionate to the legitimate aim pursued. such presumptions should be rebuttable and in any event, should be used
only where the [rights of the defence](3974) are respected.

(23)

in various member [State](883) not only the prosecution, but also [judge](1537) and competent courts are [charge](4882) with
seeking both inculpatory and exculpatory [evidence](4434)  member [State](883) which do not have an adversarial system
should be able to maintain their current system provided that it complies with this [directive](448) and with other
relevant [provision](3446) of union and [international law](565) 

(24)

the right to remain silent is an [import](1309) aspect of the presumption of innocence and should serve as protection
from self-incrimination.

(25)

the right not to incriminate oneself is also an [import](1309) aspect of the presumption of innocence. suspects and
accused persons should not be forced, when asked to make [State](883) or answer questions, to produce [evidence](4434) or [document](486) or to provide [information](1422) which may [lead](2428) to self-incrimination.

(26)

the right to remain silent and the right not to incriminate oneself should apply to questions relating to the
criminal [offence](1432) that a person is suspected or accused of having committed and not, for example, to questions
relating to the identification of a suspect or accused person.

(27)

the right to remain silent and the right not to incriminate oneself imply that competent authorities should not
compel suspects or accused persons to provide [information](1422) if those persons do not wish to do so. in order to
determine whether the right to remain silent or the right not to incriminate oneself has been violated, the inter­
pretation by the [euro](665) court of [human rights](584) of the right to a fair trial under the echr should be taken
into [account](61) 

(28)

the exercise of the right to remain silent or the right not to incriminate oneself should not be used against a
suspect or accused person and should not, in itself, be considered to be [evidence](4434) that the person concerned has
committed the criminal [offence](1432) concerned. this should be without prejudice to [national](3521) rules concerning the
[assessment](184) of [evidence](4434) by courts or [judge](1537)  provided that the [rights of the defence](3974) are respected.

(29)

the exercise of the right not to incriminate oneself should not prevent the competent authorities from gathering
[evidence](4434) which may be lawfully obtained from the suspect or accused person through the use of legal powers of
compulsion and which has an existence independent of the will of the suspect or accused person, such as
material acquired pursuant to a [war](1210)  material in respect of which there is a legal obligation of retention and
[production](2707) upon request, breath, blood or urine samples and bodily tissue for the purpose of [DNA](6260) [testing](867) 

(30)

the right to remain silent and the right not to incriminate oneself should not preclude member [State](883) from
deciding that, with regard to minor [offence](1432)  such as minor [road traffic](3127) [offence](1432)  the conduct of the proceedings,
or certain stages thereof, may take place in writing or without questioning of the suspect or accused person by
the competent authorities in relation to the [offence](1432) concerned, provided that this complies with the right to a fair
trial.

(31)

member [State](883) should consider ensuring that, where suspects or accused persons are provided with [information](1422) about rights pursuant to [arts](2688) 3 of [directive](448) 2012/13/eu, they are also provided with [information](1422) concerning
the right not to incriminate oneself, as it applies under [national](3521) law in accordance with this [directive](448) 

11.3.2016

en

[Official Journal](1533) of the [euro](665) union

l 65/5

(32)

member [State](883) should consider ensuring that, where suspects or accused persons are provided with a letter of
rights pursuant to [arts](2688) 4 of [directive](448) 2012/13/eu, such a letter also contains [information](1422) concerning the
right not to incriminate oneself as it applies under [national](3521) law in accordance with this [directive](448) 

(33)

the right to a fair trial is one of the basic principles in a democratic society. the right of suspects and accused
persons to be present at the trial is based on that right and should be ensured throughout the union.

(34)

if, for reasons beyond their control, suspects or accused persons are unable to be present at the trial, they should
have the possibility to request a new date for the trial within the time frame provided for in [national](3521) law.

(35)

the right of suspects and accused persons to be present at the trial is not absolute. under certain conditions,
suspects and accused persons should be able, expressly or tacitly, but unequivocally, to waive that right.

(36)

under certain circumstances it should be possible for a [decision](348) on the guilt or innocence of a suspect or accused
person to be handed down even if the person concerned is not present at the trial. this might be the case where
the suspect or accused person has been informed, in due time, of the trial and of the consequences of nonappearance and does not, nevertheless, appear. informing a suspect or accused person of the trial should be
understood to mean summoning him or her in person or, by other means, providing that person with official
[information](1422) about the date and place of the trial in a [man](5281) that enables him or her to become aware of the
trial. informing the suspect or accused person of the consequences of non-appearance should, in particular, be
understood to mean informing that person that a [decision](348) might be handed down if he or she does not appear at
the trial.

(37)

it should also be possible to hold a trial which may result in a [decision](348) on guilt or innocence in the absence of a
suspect or accused person where that person has been informed of the trial and has given a [man](5281) to a lawyer
who was appointed by that person or by the [State](883) to represent him or her at the trial and who represented the
suspect or accused person.

(38)

when considering whether the way in which the [information](1422) is provided is sufficient to ensure the person's
awareness of the trial, particular attention should, where appropriate, also be paid to the diligence exercised by
public authorities in order to inform the person concerned and to the diligence exercised by the person
concerned in order to receive [information](1422) addressed to him or her.

(39)

where member [State](883) provide for the possibility of holding trials in the absence of suspects or accused persons
but the conditions for taking a [decision](348) in the absence of a particular suspect or accused person are not met
because the suspect or accused person could not be located despite reasonable efforts having been made, for
example because the person has fled or absconded, it should nevertheless be possible to take a [decision](348) in the
absence of the suspect or accused person and to enforce that [decision](348)  in that case, member [State](883) should ensure
that when suspects or accused persons are informed of the [decision](348)  in particular when they are apprehended,
they should also be informed of the possibility to [challenge  [V4.3]](8458) [decision](348) and of the right to a new trial or to
another legal remedy. such [information](1422) should be provided in writing. the [information](1422) may also be provided
orally on condition that the fact that the [information](1422) has been provided is noted in accordance with the
[record](3871) procedure under [national](3521) law.

(40)

competent authorities in the member [State](883) should be allowed to exclude a suspect or accused person
temporarily from the trial where this is in the [interest](1476) of securing the proper conduct of the [criminal proceedings](5415)  this could, for example, be the case where a suspect or accused person disturbs the hearing and
must be escorted out of the court room on order of the [judge](1537)  or where it appears that the presence of a suspect
or accused person prevents the proper hearing of a witness.

(41)

the right to be present at the trial can be exercised only if one or more hearings are held. this means that the
right to be present at the trial cannot apply if the relevant [national](3521) [rules of procedure](3561) do not provide for a
hearing. such [national](3521) rules should comply with the charter and with the echr, as interpreted by the court of
justice and by the [euro](665) court of [human rights](584)  in particular with regard to the right to a fair trial. this is
the case, for example, if the proceedings are conducted in a simplified [man](5281) following, solely or in part, a
written procedure or a procedure in which no hearing is provided for.

(42)

member [State](883) should ensure that in the implementation of this [directive](448)  in particular with regard to the right
to be present at the trial and the right to a new trial, the particular needs of vulnerable persons are taken into
[account](61)  according to the commission [recommendation](2926) of 27 november 2013 on procedural safeguards for
vulnerable persons suspected or accused in [criminal proceedings](5415) (1), vulnerable suspects or accused persons
should be understood to mean all suspects or accused persons who are not able to understand or effectively
participate in [criminal proceedings](5415) due to their age, their mental or physical condition or any disabilities they
may have.

(43)

[child](758) are vulnerable and should be given a specific degree of protection. therefore, in respect of some of the
rights provided for in this [directive](448)  specific procedural safeguards should be established.

(44)

the principle of effectiveness of union law requires that member [State](883) put in place adequate and effective
remedies in the event of a breach of a right conferred upon individuals by union law. an effective remedy, which
is available in the event of a breach of any of the rights laid down in this [directive](448)  should, as far as possible,
have the effect of placing the suspects or accused persons in the same position in which they would have found
themselves had the breach not occurred, with a view to protecting the right to a fair trial and the [rights of the defence](3974) 

(45)

when assessing [State](883) made by suspects or accused persons or [evidence](4434) obtained in breach of the right to
remain silent or the right not to incriminate oneself, courts and [judge](1537) should respect the [rights of the defence](3974) and the fairness of the proceedings. in that context, regard should be had to the [case-law](1550) of the [euro](665) court
of [human rights](584)  according to which the admission of [State](883) obtained as a result of [torture](4467) or of other illtreatment in breach of [arts](2688) 3 echr as [evidence](4434) to establish the relevant facts in [criminal proceedings](5415) would
render the proceedings as a whole unfair. according to the [UN convention](201) against [torture](4467) and other cruel,
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, any [State](883) which is established to have been made as a
result of [torture](4467) should not be invoked as [evidence](4434) in any proceedings, except against a person accused of [torture](4467) as [evidence](4434) that the [State](883) was made.

(46)

in order to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of this [directive](448)  member [State](883) should send available data
with regard to the implementation of the rights laid down in this [directive](448) to the commission. such data could
include [record](3871) made by law enforcement and judicial authorities as regards remedies applied in the case of a
breach of any of the aspects of the presumption of innocence covered by this [directive](448) or of the right to be
present at the trial.

(47)

this [directive](448) upholds the fundamental rights and principles recognised by the charter and by the echr,
including the prohibition of [torture](4467) and inhuman or degrading treatment, the right to liberty and [securities](4646) 
respect for private and [family](965) life, the right to the integrity of the person, the rights of the [child](758)  the integration
of persons with disabilities, the right to an effective remedy and the right to a fair trial, the presumption of
innocence and the [rights of the defence](3974)  regard should be had, in particular, to [arts](2688) 6 of the treaty on
[euro](665) union (teu), according to which the union recognises the rights, freedoms and principles set out in
the charter, and according to which fundamental rights, as [guarantee](1129) by the echr and as they result from the
[constitution](148) traditions common to the member [State](883)  are to constitute general principles of union law.

(48)

as this [directive](448) establishes minimum rules, member [State](883) should be able to extend the rights laid down in this
[directive](448) in order to provide a higher level of protection. the level of protection provided for by member [State](883) should never fall below the [standard](2077) provided for by the charter or by the echr, as interpreted by the court of
justice and by the [euro](665) court of [human rights](584) 

(49)

since the objectives of this [directive](448)  namely setting common minimum rules for certain aspects of the
presumption of innocence and for the right to be present at the trial in [criminal proceedings](5415)  cannot be
sufficiently achieved by the member [State](883) but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at
union level, the union may adopt measures in accordance with the [principle of subsidiarity](5812) as set out in
[arts](2688) 5 teu. in accordance with the [principle of proportionality](6133)  as set out in that [arts](2688)  this [directive](448) does
not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
