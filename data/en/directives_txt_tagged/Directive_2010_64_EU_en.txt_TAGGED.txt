[directive](448) [directive](448) 2010/64/eu of the [euro](665) [parliament](2242) and of the council
of 20 october 2010
on the right to interpretation and [translation](4478) in [criminal proceedings](5415) the [euro](665) [parliament](2242) and the [Council of Europe](121) union,

(2)

on 29 november 2000, the council, in accordance with
the tampere conclusions, adopted a programme of
measures to implement the principle of mutual recog­
nition of [decision](348) in criminal matters (3). the intro­
duction to the programme [State](883) that mutual recognition
is ‘designed to strengthen cooperation between member
[State](883) but also to enhance the protection of individual
rights’.

(3)

the implementation of the principle of mutual recog­
nition of [decision](348) in criminal matters presupposes that
member [State](883) have [trust](4574) in each other’s criminal justice
systems. the extent of mutual recognition is very much
dependent on a number of parameters, which include
mechanisms for safeguarding the rights of suspected or
accused persons and common minimum [standard](2077) necessary to facilitate the application of the principle of
mutual recognition.

(4)

mutual recognition of [decision](348) in criminal matters can
operate effectively only in a [spirits](601) of [trust](4574) in which not
only judicial authorities but all actors in the criminal
process consider [decision](348) of the judicial authorities of
other member [State](883) as equivalent to their own, implying
not only [trust](4574) in the adequacy of other member [State](883) 
rules, but also [trust](4574) that those rules are correctly applied.

(5)

[arts](2688) 6 of the [euro](665) convention for the protection
of [human rights](584) and fundamental freedoms (hereinafter
the echr) and [arts](2688) 47 of the charter of fundamental
rights of the [euro](665) union (hereinafter the charter)
enshrine the right to a fair trial. [arts](2688) 48(2) of the
charter [guarantee](1129) respect for the right of defence. this
[directive](448) respects those rights and should be imple­
mented accordingly.

having regard to the treaty on the functioning of the [euro](665) union, and in particular point (b) of the second subparagraph
of [arts](2688) 82(2) thereof,

having regard to the initiative of the kingdom of [Belgium](4839)  the
federal [republic](3413) of [Germany](1318)  the [republic](3413) of [Estonia](5619)  the
kingdom of [Spain](863)  the french [republic](3413)  the italian [republic](3413) 
the grand-duchy of [Luxembourg](1712)  the [republic](3413) of [Hungary](1255)  the
[republic](3413) of [Austria](4353)  the portuguese [republic](3413)  [Romania](3763)  the
[republic](3413) of [Finland](1019) and the kingdom of [Sweden](4320) (1),

after transmission of the draft legislative act to the [national](3521) [parliament](2242) 

acting in accordance with the ordinary [legislative procedure](2702) (2),

whereas:

(1)

the union has set itself the objective of maintaining and
developing an area of freedom, [securities](4646) and justice.
according to the presidency conclusions of the
[euro](665) council in tampere of 15 and 16 october
1999, and in particular point 33 thereof, the principle
of mutual recognition of judgments and other [decision](348) of judicial authorities should become the cornerstone of
[judicial cooperation](217) in civil and criminal matters within
the union because enhanced mutual recognition and the
necessary approximation of [legislation](1589) would facilitate
cooperation between competent authorities and the
judicial protection of individual rights.

whether other issues, for instance the presumption of
innocence, need to be addressed, in order to promote
better cooperation in that area.

although all the member [State](883) are party to the echr,
experience has shown that that alone does not always
provide a sufficient degree of [trust](4574) in the criminal justice
systems of other member [State](883) 
(12)

this [directive](448) relates to measure a of the roadmap. it
lays down common minimum rules to be applied in the
fields of interpretation and [translation](4478) in [criminal proceedings](5415) with a view to enhancing mutual [trust](4574) among member [State](883) 

(13)

this [directive](448) draws on the commission proposal for a
council [framework decision](7194) (348) on the right to interpre­
tation and to [translation](4478) in [criminal proceedings](5415) of
8 july 2009, and on the commission proposal for a
[directive](448) of the [euro](665) [parliament](2242) and of the
council on the right to interpretation and [translation](4478) in [criminal proceedings](5415) of 9 [Marches](1813) 2010.

(14)

the right to interpretation and [translation](4478) for those who
do not speak or understand the [language](1580) of the
proceedings is enshrined in [arts](2688) 6 of the echr, as
interpreted in the [case-law](1550) of the [euro](665) court of
[human rights](584)  this [directive](448) facilitates the application
of that right in practice. to that end, the aim of this
[directive](448) is to ensure the right of suspected or accused
persons to interpretation and [translation](4478) in [criminal proceedings](5415) with a view to ensuring their right to a
fair trial.

(15)

the rights provided for in this [directive](448) should also
apply, as necessary accompanying measures, to the
execution of a [euro](665) [arrest](3970) [war](1210) (2) within the
limits provided for by this [directive](448)  executing
members [State](883) should provide, and [bear  [V4.3]](8445) of,
interpretation and [translation](4478) for the benefit of the
requested persons who do not speak or understand the
[language](1580) of the proceedings.

(16)

in some member [State](883) an authority other than a court
having [jurisdiction](42) in criminal matters has competence
for imposing sanctions in relation to relatively minor
[offence](1432)  that may be the case, for example, in relation
to [traffic offence](7944) (1432) which are committed on a large scale
and which might be established following a [traffic control](3107)  in such situations, it would be unreasonable to
require that the competent authority ensure all the rights
under this [directive](448)  where the law of a member [State](883) provides for the imposition of a sanction regarding
minor [offence](1432) by such an authority and there is a
right of [appeal](5954) to a court having [jurisdiction](42) in
criminal matters, this [directive](448) should therefore apply
only to the proceedings before that court following
such an [appeal](5954) 

strengthening mutual [trust](4574) requires a more consistent
implementation of the rights and [guarantee](1129) set out in
[arts](2688) 6 of the echr. it also requires, by means of this
[directive](448) and other measures, further development within
the union of the minimum [standard](2077) set out in the
echr and the charter.

[arts](2688) 82(2) of the treaty on the functioning of the
[euro](665) union provides for the [establishment](871) of
minimum rules applicable in the member [State](883) so as
to facilitate mutual recognition of judgments and
judicial [decision](348) and [police](2440) and [judicial cooperation](217) in
criminal matters having a cross-border dimension. point
(b) of the second subparagraph of [arts](2688) 82(2) refers to
‘the rights of individuals in [criminal procedure](2704)  as one of
the areas in which minimum rules may be established.

common minimum rules should [lead](2428) to increased
confidence in the criminal justice systems of all
member [State](883)  which, in turn, should [lead](2428) to more
efficient [judicial cooperation](217) in a [climate](6011) of mutual
[trust](4574)  such common minimum rules should be estab­
lished in the fields of interpretation and [translation](4478) in
[criminal proceedings](5415) 

on 30 november 2009, the council adopted a
[resolution](3470) on a roadmap for strengthening procedural
rights of suspected or accused persons in [criminal proceedings](5415) (1). taking a step-by-step approach, the
roadmap called for the adoption of measures regarding
the right to [translation](4478) and interpretation (measure a),
the [right to information](513) (1422) on rights and [information](1422) about
the [charge](4882) (measure b), the right to legal advice and
legal [AIDS](5172) (measure c), the right to communication with
relatives, [employer](735) and consular authorities (measure d),
and special safeguards for suspected or accused persons
who are vulnerable (measure e).

in the [stock](4280) programme, adopted on 10 december
2009, the [euro](665) council welcomed the roadmap and
made it part of the [stock](4280) programme (point 2.4).
the [euro](665) council underlined the non-exhaustive
character of the roadmap, by inviting the commission
to examine further elements of minimum procedural
rights for suspected and accused persons, and to assess

this [directive](448) should ensure that there is free and
adequate linguistic assistance, allowing suspected or
accused persons who do not speak or understand the
[language](1580) of the [criminal proceedings](5415) fully to exercise
their right of defence and safeguarding the fairness of
the proceedings.

interpretation for the benefit of the suspected or accused
persons should be provided without delay. however,
where a certain period of time elapses before interpre­
tation is provided, that should not constitute an
infringement of the requirement that interpretation be
provided without delay, as long as that period of time
is reasonable in the circumstances.

(23)

the respect for the right to interpretation and [translation](4478) contained in this [directive](448) should not compromise any
other procedural right provided under [national](3521) law.

(24)

member [State](883) should ensure that control can be
exercised over the adequacy of the interpretation and
[translation](4478) provided when the competent authorities
have been put on notice in a given case.

(25)

the suspected or accused persons or the persons subject
to proceedings for the execution of a [euro](665) [arrest](3970) [war](1210) should have the right to [challenge  [V4.3]](8458) finding
that there is no need for interpretation, in accordance
with procedures in [national](3521) law. that right does not
entail the obligation for member [State](883) to provide for
a separate mechanism or complaint procedure in which
such finding may be [challenge  [V4.3]](8458) not prejudice
the time limits applicable to the execution of a [euro](665) [arrest](3970) [war](1210) 

(26)

when the quality of the interpretation is considered
insufficient to ensure the right to a fair trial, the
competent authorities should be able to replace the
appointed interpreter.

(27)

the duty of care towards suspected or accused persons
who are in a potentially weak position, in particular
because of any physical impairments which affect their
ability to communicate effectively, underpins a fair
administration of justice. the prosecution, law
enforcement and judicial authorities should therefore
ensure that such persons are able to exercise effectively
the rights provided for in this [directive](448)  for example by
taking into [account](61) any potential vulnerability that
affects their ability to follow the proceedings and to
make themselves understood, and by taking appropriate
steps to ensure those rights are [guarantee](1129) 

(28)

when using videoconferencing for the purpose of remote
interpretation, the competent authorities should be able
to rely on the tools that are being developed in the
context of [euro](665) e-justice (e.g. [information](1422) on
courts with videoconferencing equipment or [man](5281) .

(29)

this [directive](448) should be evaluated in the light of the
practical experience gained. if appropriate, it should be
amended so as to improve the safeguards which it lays
down.

communication between suspected or accused persons
and their legal counsel should be interpreted in
accordance with this [directive](448)  suspected or accused
persons should be able, inter alia, to explain their
version of the events to their legal counsel, point out
any [State](883) with which they disagree and make
their legal counsel aware of any facts that should be
put forward in their defence.

for the purposes of the preparation of the defence,
communication between suspected or accused persons
and their legal counsel in direct connection with any
questioning or hearing during the proceedings, or with
the lodging of an [appeal](5954) or other procedural applications,
such as an application for bail, should be interpreted
where necessary in order to safeguard the fairness of
the proceedings.

member [State](883) should ensure that there is a procedure or
mechanism in place to ascertain whether suspected or
accused persons speak and understand the [language](1580) of
the [criminal proceedings](5415) and whether they need the
assistance of an interpreter. such procedure or
mechanism implies that competent authorities verify in
any appropriate [man](5281)  including by consulting the
suspected or accused persons concerned, whether they
speak and understand the [language](1580) of the [criminal proceedings](5415) and whether they need the assistance of an
interpreter.

interpretation and [translation](4478) under this [directive](448) should
be provided in the native [language](1580) of the suspected or
accused persons or in any other [language](1580) that they speak
or understand in order to allow them fully to exercise
their right of defence, and in order to safeguard the
fairness of the proceedings.

safeguarding the fairness of the proceedings requires that
essential [document](486)  or at least the relevant passages of
such [document](486)  be translated for the benefit of
suspected or accused persons in accordance with this
[directive](448)  certain [document](486) should always be
considered essential for that purpose and should
therefore be translated, such as any [decision](348) depriving
a person of his liberty, any [charge](4882) or indictment, and
any judgment. it is for the competent authorities of the
member [State](883) to decide, on their own motion or upon a
request of suspected or accused persons or of their legal
counsel, which other [document](486) are essential to
safeguard the fairness of the proceedings and should
therefore be translated as well.

member [State](883) should facilitate access to [national](3521) [database](4821) of legal translators and interpreters where
such [database](4821) exist. in that context, particular
attention should be paid to the aim of providing access
to existing [database](4821) through the e-justice portal, as
[plan](7379) in the multiannual [euro](665) e-justice action

[principle of proportionality](6133)  as set out in that [arts](2688)

(32)

this [directive](448) should set minimum rules. member [State](883) should be able to extend the rights set out in this
[directive](448) in order to provide a higher level of protection
also in situations not explicitly dealt with in this
[directive](448)  the level of protection should never fall
below the [standard](2077) provided by the echr or the
charter as interpreted in the [case-law](1550) of the [euro](665) court of [human rights](584) or the court of justice of the
[euro](665) union.

(33)

the [provision](3446) of this [directive](448) that correspond to rights
[guarantee](1129) by the echr or the charter should be inter­
preted and implemented consistently with those rights, as
interpreted in the relevant [case-law](1550) of the [euro](665) court of [human rights](584) and the court of justice of the
[euro](665) union.

(34)

since the objective of this [directive](448)  namely establishing
common minimum rules, cannot be sufficiently achieved
by the member [State](883) and can therefore, by reason of its
scale and effects, be better achieved at union level, the
union may adopt measures in accordance with the
[principle of subsidiarity](5812) as set out in [arts](2688) 5 of the
