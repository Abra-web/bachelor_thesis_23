[directive](448) [directive](448) 2010/64/eu of the [EURES](4054) [parliament](2242) and of the council
of 20 october 2010
on the right to [interpreting](1482) and [translation](4478) in [criminal proceedings](5415) the [EURES](4054) [parliament](2242) and the [Council of Europe](121) union,

(2)

on 29 november 2000, the council, in accordance with
the tampere conclusions, adopted a programme of
measures to implement the principle of mutual recog­
nition of [decision](348) in criminal matters (3). the intro­
duction to the programme [State](883) that mutual recognition
is ‘designed to strengthen [cooperative](227) between member
[State](883) but also to enhance the [protectionism](2844) of individual
rights’.

(3)

the implementation of the principle of mutual recog­
nition of [decision](348) in criminal matters presupposes that
member [State](883) have [trust](4574) in each other’s criminal justice
systems. the extent of mutual recognition is very much
[dependant](5390) on a number of parameters, which include
[mechanisation](1848) for safeguarding the rights of suspected or
accused persons and common minimum [standard](2077) necessary to facilitate the application of the principle of
mutual recognition.

(4)

mutual recognition of [decision](348) in criminal matters can
operate effectively only in a [spirits](601) of [trust](4574) in which not
only judicial authorities but all actors in the criminal
process consider [decision](348) of the judicial authorities of
other member [State](883) as equivalent to their own, implying
not only [trust](4574) in the adequacy of other member [State](883) 
[ruling](1538)  but also [trust](4574) that those [ruling](1538) are correctly applied.

[arts](2688) 6 of the [EURES](4054) convention for the [protectionism](2844) of [human rights](584) and fundamental freedoms (hereinafter
the echr) and [arts](2688) 47 of the [chartering](254) of fundamental
rights of the [EURES](4054) union (hereinafter the [chartering](254) 
enshrine the right to a fair trial. [arts](2688) 48(2) of the
[chartering](254) [guarantee](1129) respect for the right of defence. this
[directive](448) respects those rights and should be imple­
mented accordingly.

having regard to the treaty on the functioning of the [EURES](4054) union, and in particular point (b) of the second subparagraph
of [arts](2688) 82(2) thereof,

having regard to the initiative of the kingdom of [Belgium](4839)  the
[federalism](3042) [republic](3413) of germany, the [republic](3413) of [Estonia](5619)  the
kingdom of [Spain](863)  the french [republic](3413)  the [Italy](1519) [republic](3413) 
the grand-duchy of [Luxembourg](1712)  the [republic](3413) of hungary, the
[republic](3413) of [Austria](4353)  the [Portugal](2563) [republic](3413)  [Romania](3763)  the
[republic](3413) of [Finland](1019) and the kingdom of [Sweden](4320) (1),

after transmission of the draft [legislation](1589) act to the [[[nationality](2034) (2033) (3521) [parliament](2242) 

acting in accordance with the [ordinance](2158) [legislation](1589) procedure (2),

whereas:

(1)

the union has set itself the objective of maintaining and
developing an area of freedom, [securities](4646) and justice.
according to the presidency conclusions of the
[EURES](4054) council in tampere of 15 and 16 october
1999, and in particular point 33 thereof, the principle
of mutual recognition of [judge](1537) and other [decision](348) of judicial authorities should become the cornerstone of
[judicial cooperation](217) (227) in civil and criminal matters within
the union because enhanced mutual recognition and the
necessary approximation of [legislation](1589) would facilitate
[cooperative](227) between competent authorities and the
judicial [protectionism](2844) of individual rights.

whether other issues, for instance the presumption of
innocence, need to be addressed, in order to [promotion](2807) better [cooperative](227) in that area.

although all the member [State](883) are party to the echr,
experience has shown that that alone does not always
provide a sufficient degree of [trust](4574) in the criminal justice
systems of other member [State](883) 
(12)

this [directive](448) relates to measure a of the roadmap. it
lays down common minimum [ruling](1538) to be applied in the
fields of [interpreting](1482) and [translation](4478) in [criminal proceedings](5415) with a view to enhancing mutual [trust](4574) among member [State](883) 

(13)

this [directive](448) draws on the commission proposal for a
council [framework decision](7194) (348) on the right to interpre­
tation and to [translation](4478) in [criminal proceedings](5415) of
8 july 2009, and on the commission proposal for a
[directive](448) of the [EURES](4054) [parliament](2242) and of the
council on the right to [interpreting](1482) and [translation](4478) in [criminal proceedings](5415) of 9 [Marches](1813) 2010.

(14)

the right to [interpreting](1482) and [translation](4478) for those who
do not speak or understand the [language](1580) of the
proceedings is enshrined in [arts](2688) 6 of the echr, as
[interpreting](1482) in the [case-law](1550) of the [EURES](4054) court of
[human rights](584)  this [directive](448) facilitates the application
of that right in practice. to that end, the aim of this
[directive](448) is to ensure the right of suspected or accused
persons to [interpreting](1482) and [translation](4478) in [criminal proceedings](5415) with a view to ensuring their right to a
fair trial.

(15)

the rights provided for in this [directive](448) should also
apply, as necessary accompanying measures, to the
[executive](5080) of a [EURES](4054) [arrest](3970) [war](1210) (2) within the
limits provided for by this [directive](448)  [executive](5080) members [State](883) should provide, and [[bearing](3759)  [V4.3]](8445) of,
[interpreting](1482) and [translation](4478) for the benefit of the
requested persons who do not speak or understand the
[language](1580) of the proceedings.

(16)

in some member [State](883) an authority other than a court
having [jurisdiction](42) in criminal matters has competence
for imposing sanctions in relation to relatively minor
[offence](1432)  that may be the case, for example, in relation
to [traffic offence](7944) (1432) which are committed on a large scale
and which might be [establishment](871) following a [traffic control](3107)  in such situations, it would be unreasonable to
require that the competent authority ensure all the rights
under this [directive](448)  where the law of a member [State](883) provides for the imposition of a sanction regarding
minor [offence](1432) by such an authority and there is a
right of [appeal](5954) to a court having [jurisdiction](42) in
criminal matters, this [directive](448) should therefore apply
only to the proceedings before that court following
such an [appeal](5954) 

strengthening mutual [trust](4574) requires a more consistent
implementation of the rights and [guarantee](1129) set out in
[arts](2688) 6 of the echr. it also requires, by means of this
[directive](448) and other measures, further development within
the union of the minimum [standard](2077) set out in the
echr and the [chartering](254) 

[arts](2688) 82(2) of the treaty on the functioning of the
[EURES](4054) union provides for the [establishment](871) of
minimum [ruling](1538) applicable in the member [State](883) so as
to facilitate mutual recognition of [judge](1537) and
judicial [decision](348) and [police](2440) and [judicial cooperation](217) (227) in
criminal matters having a cross-border dimension. point
(b) of the second subparagraph of [arts](2688) 82(2) refers to
‘the rights of individuals in [criminal procedure](2704)  as one of
the areas in which minimum [ruling](1538) may be [establishment](871) 

common minimum [ruling](1538) should [lead](2428) to increased
confidence in the criminal justice systems of all
member [State](883)  which, in turn, should [lead](2428) to more
efficient [judicial cooperation](217) (227) in a [climate](6011) of mutual
[trust](4574)  such common minimum [ruling](1538) should be estab­
lished in the fields of [interpreting](1482) and [translation](4478) in
[criminal proceedings](5415) 

on 30 november 2009, the council adopted a
[resolution](3470) on a roadmap for strengthening procedural
rights of suspected or accused persons in [criminal proceedings](5415) (1). taking a step-by-step approach, the
roadmap called for the adoption of measures regarding
the right to [translation](4478) and [interpreting](1482) (measure a),
the [right to information](513) (1422) on rights and [information](1422) about
the [charge](4882) (measure b), the right to [legality](1588) advice and
[legality](1588) [AIDS](5172) (measure c), the right to communication with
relatives, [employer](735) and [consulate](5535) authorities (measure d),
and special safeguards for suspected or accused persons
who are vulnerable (measure e).

in the [stock](4280) programme, adopted on 10 december
2009, the [EURES](4054) council welcomed the roadmap and
made it part of the [stock](4280) programme (point 2.4).
the [EURES](4054) council underlined the non-exhaustive
character of the roadmap, by inviting the commission
to [examination](925) further elements of minimum procedural
rights for suspected and accused persons, and to [assessment](184)

this [directive](448) should ensure that there is free and
adequate [linguistics](1670) assistance, allowing suspected or
accused persons who do not speak or understand the
[language](1580) of the [criminal proceedings](5415) fully to exercise
their right of defence and safeguarding the fairness of
the proceedings.

[interpreting](1482) for the benefit of the suspected or accused
persons should be provided without delay. however,
where a certain period of time elapses before interpre­
tation is provided, that should not [constitution](148) an
infringement of the requirement that [interpreting](1482) be
provided without delay, as long as that period of time
is reasonable in the circumstances.

(23)

the respect for the right to [interpreting](1482) and [translation](4478) [container](158) in this [directive](448) should not compromise any
other procedural right provided under [[[nationality](2034) (2033) (3521) law.

(24)

member [State](883) should ensure that control can be
exercised over the adequacy of the [interpreting](1482) and
[translation](4478) provided when the competent authorities
have been put on notice in a given case.

(25)

the suspected or accused persons or the persons subject
to proceedings for the [executive](5080) of a [EURES](4054) [arrest](3970) [war](1210) should have the right to [challenge  [V4.3]](8458) finding
that there is no need for [interpreting](1482)  in accordance
with procedures in [[[nationality](2034) (2033) (3521) law. that right does not
entail the obligation for member [State](883) to provide for
a separate [mechanisation](1848) or complaint procedure in which
such finding may be [challenge  [V4.3]](8458) not prejudice
the time limits applicable to the [executive](5080) of a [EURES](4054) [arrest](3970) [war](1210) 

(26)

when the quality of the [interpreting](1482) is considered
insufficient to ensure the right to a fair trial, the
competent authorities should be able to replace the
appointed [interpreting](1482) 

(27)

the duty of care towards suspected or accused persons
who are in a potentially weak position, in particular
because of any physical impairments which affect their
ability to communicate effectively, underpins a fair
[administrator  [V4.3]](8542) justice. the prosecution, law
enforcement and judicial authorities should therefore
ensure that such persons are able to exercise effectively
the rights provided for in this [directive](448)  for example by
taking into [[[accounting](54) (60) (61) any potential vulnerability that
affects their ability to follow the proceedings and to
make themselves understood, and by taking appropriate
steps to ensure those rights are [guarantee](1129) 

(28)

when using videoconferencing for the purpose of remote
[interpreting](1482)  the competent authorities should be able
to rely on the tools that are being developed in the
context of [EURES](4054) e-justice (e.g. [information](1422) on
courts with videoconferencing equipment or [man](5281) .

(29)

this [directive](448) should be evaluated in the [lighting](626) of the
practical experience gained. if appropriate, it should be
[amendment](1558) so as to improve the safeguards which it lays
down.

communication between suspected or accused persons
and their [legality](1588) counsel should be [interpreting](1482) in
accordance with this [directive](448)  suspected or accused
persons should be able, inter alia, to explain their
version of the events to their [legality](1588) counsel, point out
any [State](883) with which they disagree and make
their [legality](1588) counsel aware of any facts that should be
put forward in their defence.

for the purposes of the preparation of the defence,
communication between suspected or accused persons
and their [legality](1588) counsel in [directive](448) connection with any
questioning or hearing during the proceedings, or with
the lodging of an [appeal](5954) or other procedural applications,
such as an application for bail, should be [interpreting](1482) where necessary in order to safeguard the fairness of
the proceedings.

member [State](883) should ensure that there is a procedure or
[mechanisation](1848) in place to ascertain whether suspected or
accused persons speak and understand the [language](1580) of
the [criminal proceedings](5415) and whether they need the
[assistant  [V4.3]](8407) [interpreting](1482)  such procedure or
[mechanisation](1848) implies that competent authorities verify in
any appropriate [man](5281)  including by [consulate](5535) the
suspected or accused persons concerned, whether they
speak and understand the [language](1580) of the [criminal proceedings](5415) and whether they need the [assistant  [V4.3]](8407) [interpreting](1482) 

[interpreting](1482) and [translation](4478) under this [directive](448) should
be provided in the native [language](1580) of the suspected or
accused persons or in any other [language](1580) that they speak
or understand in order to allow them fully to exercise
their right of defence, and in order to safeguard the
fairness of the proceedings.
