[directive](448) [directive](448) (eu) 2016/800 of the [euro](665) [parliament](2242) and of the council
of 11 may 2016
on procedural safeguards for [child](758) who are suspects or accused persons in [criminal proceedings](5415) the [euro](665) [parliament](2242) and the [Council of Europe](121) union,

having regard to the treaty on the functioning of the [euro](665) union, and in particular point (b) of [arts](2688) 82(2)
thereof,
having regard to the proposal from the [euro](665) commission,
after transmission of the draft legislative act to the [national](3521) [parliament](2242) 
having regard to the [opinion](4449) of the [euro](665) economic and social committee (1),
after consulting the [Committee of the Regions](5508) 
acting in accordance with the ordinary [legislative procedure](2702) (2),
whereas:
(1)

the purpose of this [directive](448) is to establish procedural safeguards to ensure that [child](758)  meaning persons
under the age of 18, who are suspects or accused persons in [criminal proceedings](5415)  are able to understand and
follow those proceedings and to exercise their right to a fair trial, and to prevent [child](758) from re-offending and
foster their [social integration](1469) 

(2)

by establishing common minimum rules on the protection of procedural rights of [child](758) who are suspects or
accused persons, this [directive](448) aims to strengthen the [trust](4574) of member [State](883) in each other's criminal justice
systems and thus to improve mutual recognition of [decision](348) in criminal matters. such common minimum rules
should also remove obstacles to the free movement of citizens throughout the territory of the member [State](883) 

(3)

although the member [State](883) are parties to the [euro](665) convention for the protection of [human rights](584) and
fundamental freedoms (echr), the international covenant on civil and [[political rights](3900) (582)  and the [UN convention](201) on the rights of the [child](758)  experience has shown that this in itself does not always provide a sufficient degree of
[trust](4574) in the criminal justice systems of other member [State](883) 

(4)

on 30 november 2009, the council adopted a [resolution](3470) on a roadmap for strengthening the procedural rights
of suspected or accused persons in [criminal proceedings](5415) (3) (‘the roadmap’). taking a step-by-step approach, the
roadmap calls for the adoption of measures regarding the right to [translation](4478) and interpretation (measure a), the
[right to information](513) (1422) on rights and [information](1422) about the [charge](4882) (measure b), the right to legal advice and legal
[AIDS](5172) (measure c), the right to communicate with relatives, [employer](735) and consular authorities (measure d), and
special safeguards for suspected or accused persons who are vulnerable (measure e). the roadmap emphasises

2016.

that the order of the rights is indicative and thus implies that it may be changed in accordance with priorities.
the roadmap is designed to operate as a whole; only when all its components are implemented will its benefits
be experienced in full.
(5)

on 11 december 2009, the [euro](665) council welcomed the roadmap and made it part of the [stock](4280) programme — an open and secure [euro](665) serving and protecting citizens (1) (point 2.4). the [euro](665) council
underlined the non-exhaustive character of the roadmap by inviting the commission to examine further
elements of minimum procedural rights for suspects and accused persons, and to assess whether other issues, for
instance the presumption of innocence, need to be addressed, in order to promote better cooperation in that
area.

(6)

four measures on procedural rights in [criminal proceedings](5415) have been adopted pursuant to the roadmap to date,
namely [directive](448) 2010/64/eu (2), 2012/13/eu (3), 2013/48/eu (4) and [directive](448) (eu) 2016/343 (5) of the
[euro](665) [parliament](2242) and the council.

(7)

this [directive](448) promotes the rights of the [child](758)  taking into [account](61) the [guide](5311) of the [Council of Europe](121) on
[child](758) friendly justice.

(8)

where [child](758) are suspects or accused persons in [criminal proceedings](5415) or are subject to [euro](665) [arrest](3970) [war](1210) proceedings pursuant to council [framework decision](7194) (348) 2002/584/jha (6) (requested persons), member [State](883) should ensure that the [child](758) s best [interest](1476) are always a primary consideration, in accordance with [arts](2688) 24(2)
of the charter of fundamental rights of the [euro](665) union (the charter).

(9)

[child](758) who are suspects or accused persons in [criminal proceedings](5415) should be given particular attention in
order to preserve their potential for development and reintegration into society.

(10)

this [directive](448) should apply to [child](758) who are suspects or accused persons in [criminal proceedings](5415) and to
[child](758) who are requested persons. in respect of [child](758) who are requested persons, the relevant [provision](3446) of
this [directive](448) should apply from the time of their [arrest](3970) in the executing member [State](883) 

(11)

this [directive](448)  or certain [provision](3446) thereof, should also apply to suspects or accused persons in [criminal proceedings](5415)  and to requested persons, who were [child](758) when they became subject to the proceedings, but who
have subsequently reached the age of 18, and where the application of this [directive](448) is appropriate in the light of
all the circumstances of the case, including the maturity and vulnerability of the person concerned.

(12)

when, at the time a person becomes a suspect or accused person in [criminal proceedings](5415)  that person has
reached the age of 18, but the criminal [offence](1432) was committed when the person was a [child](758)  member [State](883) are
encouraged to apply the procedural safeguards provided for by this [directive](448) until that person reaches the age
of 21, at least as regards criminal [offence](1432) that are committed by the same suspect or accused person and that
are jointly investigated and prosecuted as they are inextricably linked to [criminal proceedings](5415) which were
initiated against that person before the age of 18.

(13)

member [State](883) should determine the age of the [child](758) on the basis of the [child](758) s own [State](883)  checks of the
[child](758) s [civil status](884)  [document](486) [research](2914)  other [evidence](4434) and, if such [evidence](4434) is unavailable or inconclusive, a
[medical examination](5307) (925)  a [medical examination](5307) (925) should be carried out as a last resort and in strict compliance with
the [child](758) s rights, physical integrity and human dignity. where a person's age remains in doubt, that person
should, for the purposes of this [directive](448)  be presumed to be a [child](758)

(14)

this [directive](448) should not apply in respect of certain minor [offence](1432)  however, it should apply where a [child](758) who
is a suspect or accused person is deprived of liberty.

(15)

in some member [State](883) an authority other than a court having [jurisdiction](42) in criminal matters has competence
for imposing sanctions other than deprivation of liberty in relation to relatively minor [offence](1432)  that may be the
case, for example, in relation to [road traffic](3127) [offence](1432) which are committed on a large scale and which might be
established following a [traffic control](3107)  in such situations, it would be unreasonable to require that the competent
authorities ensure all the rights under this [directive](448)  where the law of a member [State](883) provides for the
imposition of a sanction regarding minor [offence](1432) by such an authority and there is either a right of [appeal](5954) or
the possibility for the case to be otherwise referred to a court having [jurisdiction](42) in criminal matters, this
[directive](448) should therefore apply only to the proceedings before that court following such an [appeal](5954) or referral.

(16)

in some member [State](883) certain minor [offence](1432)  in particular minor [road traffic](3127) [offence](1432)  minor [offence](1432) in
relation to general municipal [regulation](3099) and minor [public order](2162) [offence](1432)  are considered to be criminal [offence](1432) 
in such situations, it would be unreasonable to require that the competent authorities ensure all the rights under
this [directive](448)  where the law of a member [State](883) provides in respect of minor [offence](1432) that deprivation of liberty
cannot be imposed as a sanction, this [directive](448) should therefore apply only to the proceedings before a court
having [jurisdiction](42) in criminal matters.

(17)

this [directive](448) should apply only to [criminal proceedings](5415)  it should not apply to other types of proceedings, in
particular proceedings which are specially designed for [child](758) and which could [lead](2428) to protective, corrective or
educative measures.

(18)

this [directive](448) should be implemented taking into [account](61) the [provision](3446) of [directive](448) 2012/13/eu and
2013/48/eu. this [directive](448) provides for further complementary safeguards with regard to [information](1422) to be
provided to [child](758) and to the holder of [parental responsibility](3316) in order to take into [account](61) the specific needs
and vulnerabilities of [child](758) 

(19)

[child](758) should receive [information](1422) about general aspects of the conduct of the proceedings. to that end, they
should, in particular, be given a brief explanation about the next procedural steps in the proceedings in so far as
this is possible in the light of the [interest](1476) of the [criminal proceedings](5415)  and about the role of the authorities
involved. the [information](1422) to be given should depend on the circumstances of the case.

(20)

[child](758) should receive [information](1422) in respect of the right to a [medical examination](5307) (925) at the earliest appropriate
stage in the proceedings, at the latest upon deprivation of liberty where such a measure is taken in relation to the
[child](758) 

(21)

where a [child](758) is deprived of liberty, the letter of rights provided to the [child](758) pursuant to [directive](448) 2012/13/eu
should include clear [information](1422) on the [child](758) s rights under this [directive](448) 

(22)

member [State](883) should inform the holder of [parental responsibility](3316) about applicable procedural rights, in writing,
orally, or both. the [information](1422) should be provided as soon as possible and in such detail as is necessary to
safeguard the fairness of the proceedings and the effective exercise of the rights of the [child](758) 

(23)

in certain circumstances, which can also relate to only one of the persons holding [parental responsibility](3316)  the
[information](1422) should be provided to another appropriate [adult](160) nominated by the [child](758) and accepted as such by the
competent authority. one of those circumstances is where there are objective and factual grounds indicating or
giving rise to the suspicion that providing [information](1422) to the holder of [parental responsibility](3316) could substantially
jeopardise the [criminal proceedings](5415)  in particular, where [evidence](4434) might be destroyed or altered, witnesses might
be interfered with, or the holder of [parental responsibility](3316) might have been involved in the alleged criminal
activity together with the [child](758) 

(24)

where the circumstances which led the competent authorities to provide [information](1422) to an appropriate [adult](160) other than the holder of [parental responsibility](3316) cease to exist, any [information](1422) that the [child](758) receives in
accordance with this [directive](448)  and which remains relevant in the course of the proceedings, should be provided
to the holder of [parental responsibility](3316)  this requirement should not unnecessarily prolong the [criminal proceedings](5415)

(25)

[child](758) who are suspects or accused persons have the [rights of access](7352) to a lawyer in accordance with [directive](448) 2013/48/eu. since [child](758) are vulnerable and not always able to fully understand and follow [criminal proceedings](5415)  they should be assisted by a lawyer in the situations set out in this [directive](448)  in those situations,
member [State](883) should arrange for the [child](758) to be assisted by a lawyer where the [child](758) or the holder of [parental responsibility](3316) has not arranged such assistance. member [State](883) should provide legal [AIDS](5172) where this is necessary to
ensure that the [child](758) is effectively assisted by a lawyer.

(26)

assistance by a lawyer under this [directive](448) presupposes that the [child](758) has the [rights of access](7352) to a lawyer under
[directive](448) 2013/48/eu. therefore, where the application of a [provision](3446) of [directive](448) 2013/48/eu would make it
impossible for the [child](758) to be assisted by a lawyer under this [directive](448)  such [provision](3446) should not apply to the
right of [child](758) to have access to a lawyer under [directive](448) 2013/48/eu. on the other hand, the derogations and
exceptions to assistance by a lawyer laid down in this [directive](448) should not affect the [rights of access](7352) to a lawyer in
accordance with [directive](448) 2013/48/eu, or the right to legal [AIDS](5172) in accordance with the charter and the echr,
and with [national](3521) and other union law.

(27)

the [provision](3446) laid down in this [directive](448) on assistance by a lawyer should apply without undue delay once
[child](758) are made aware that they are suspects or accused persons. for the purposes of this [directive](448)  assistance
by a lawyer means legal support and representation by a lawyer during the [criminal proceedings](5415)  where this
[directive](448) provides for the assistance by a lawyer during questioning, a lawyer should be present. without
prejudice to a [child](758) s [rights of access](7352) to a lawyer pursuant to [directive](448) 2013/48/eu, assistance by a lawyer does
not require a lawyer to be present during each investigative or [evidence](4434) gathering act.

(28)

provided that this complies with the right to a fair trial, the obligation for member [State](883) to provide [child](758) who
are suspects or accused persons with assistance by a lawyer in accordance with this [directive](448) does not include
the following: identifying the [child](758)  determining whether an investigation should be started; verifying the
possession of weapons or other similar safety issues; carrying out investigative or [evidence](4434) gathering acts other
than those specifically referred to in this [directive](448)  such as body checks, physical [examination](925)  blood, [alcohol](1134) or
similar tests, or the taking of photographs or fingerprints; or bringing the [child](758) to appear before a competent
authority or surrendering the [child](758) to the holder of [parental responsibility](3316) or to another appropriate [adult](160)  in
accordance with [national](3521) law.

(29)

where a [child](758) who was not initially a suspect or accused person, such as a witness, becomes a suspect or accused
person, that [child](758) should have the right not to incriminate him or herself and the right to remain silent, in
accordance with union law and the echr, as interpreted by the court of justice of the [euro](665) union (court
of justice) and by the [euro](665) court of [human rights](584)  this [directive](448) therefore makes express reference to the
practical situation where such a [child](758) becomes a suspect or accused person during questioning by the [police](2440) or
by another law enforcement authority in the context of [criminal proceedings](5415)  where, in the course of such
questioning, a [child](758) other than a suspect or accused person becomes a suspect or accused person, questioning
should be suspended until the [child](758) is made aware that he or she is a suspect or accused person and is assisted by
a lawyer in accordance with this [directive](448) 

(30)

provided that this complies with the right to a fair trial, member [State](883) should be able to derogate from the
obligation to provide assistance by a lawyer where this is not proportionate in the light of the circumstances of
the case, it being understood that the [child](758) s best [interest](1476) should always be a primary consideration. in any
event, [child](758) should be assisted by a lawyer when they are brought before a competent court or [judge](1537) in order
to decide on detention at any stage of the proceedings within the scope of this [directive](448)  as well as during
detention. moreover, deprivation of liberty should not be imposed as a criminal sentence unless the [child](758) has
been assisted by a lawyer in such a way as to allow the [child](758) to exercise his or her [rights of the defence](3974) effectively and, in any event, during the trial hearings before a court. member [State](883) should be able to make
practical arrangements in that respect.

(31)

member [State](883) should be able to derogate temporarily from the obligation to provide assistance by a lawyer in
the pre-trial phase for compelling reasons, namely where there is an urgent need to avert serious adverse
consequences for the life, liberty or physical integrity of a person, or where immediate action by the investigating
authorities is imperative to prevent substantial jeopardy to [criminal proceedings](5415) in relation to a serious criminal
[offence](1432)  inter alia, with a view to obtaining [information](1422) concerning the alleged co-perpetrators of a serious
criminal [offence](1432)  or in order to avoid the [loss](367) of [import](1309) [evidence](4434) regarding a serious criminal [offence](1432)  during
a temporary derogation for one of those compelling reasons, the competent authorities should be able to
question [child](758) without the lawyer being present, provided that they have been informed of their right to

21.5.2016

en

[Official Journal](1533) of the [euro](665) union

l 132/5

remain silent and can exercise that right, and that such questioning does not prejudice the [rights of the defence](3974) 
including the right not to incriminate oneself. it should be possible to carry out questioning, to the extent
necessary, for the sole purpose of obtaining [information](1422) that is essential to avert serious adverse consequences
for the life, liberty or physical integrity of a person, or to prevent substantial jeopardy to [criminal proceedings](5415) 
any abuse of this temporary derogation would, in principle, irretrievably prejudice the [rights of the defence](3974) 

(32)

member [State](883) should clearly set out in their [national](3521) law the grounds and criteria for such a temporary
derogation, and they should make restricted use thereof. any temporary derogation should be proportional,
strictly limited in time, not based exclusively on the type or the seriousness of the alleged criminal [offence](1432)  and
should not prejudice the overall fairness of the proceedings. member [State](883) should ensure that where the
temporary derogation has been authorised pursuant to this [directive](448) by a competent authority which is not a
[judge](1537) or a court, the [decision](348) on authorising the temporary derogation can be assessed by a court, at least during
the trial stage.

(33)

[confidentiality](92) of communication between [child](758) and their lawyer is key to ensuring the effective exercise of
the [rights of the defence](3974) and is an essential part of the right to a fair trial. member [State](883) should therefore
respect the [confidentiality](92) of meetings and other [form](1076) of communication between the lawyer and the [child](758) in
the context of the assistance by a lawyer provided for in this [directive](448)  without derogation. this [directive](448) is
without prejudice to procedures that address the situation where there are objective and factual circumstances
giving rise to the suspicion that the lawyer is involved with the [child](758) in a criminal [offence](1432)  any criminal activity
on the part of a lawyer should not be considered to be legitimate assistance to [child](758) within the framework of
this [directive](448)  the obligation to respect [confidentiality](92) not only implies that member [State](883) refrain from
interfering with, or accessing, such communication but also that, where [child](758) are deprived of liberty or
otherwise find themselves in a place under the control of the [State](883)  member [State](883) ensure that arrangements for
communication uphold and protect such [confidentiality](92)  this is without prejudice to any mechanisms that are in
place in detention facilities with the purpose of avoiding illicit enclosures being sent to detainees, such as
[screen](5601) [correspondence](242)  provided that such mechanisms do not allow the competent authorities to read the
communication between [child](758) and their lawyer. this [directive](448) is also without prejudice to procedures under
[national](3521) law according to which forwarding [correspondence](242) may be rejected if the sender does not agree to the
[correspondence](242) first being submitted to a competent court.

(34)

this [directive](448) is without prejudice to a breach of [confidentiality](92) that is incidental to a lawful [surveillance](5144) operation by competent authorities. this [directive](448) is also without prejudice to the [work](4543) that is carried out, for
example, by [national](3521) intelligence [service](4099) to safeguard [national](3521) [securities](4646) in accordance with [arts](2688) 4(2) of the
treaty on [euro](665) union (teu), or that falls within the scope of [arts](2688) 72 of the treaty on the functioning of
the [euro](665) union (tfeu) pursuant to which title v of part iii of the tfeu, on the area of freedom, [securities](4646) and justice, must not affect the exercise of the responsibilities incumbent upon member [State](883) with regard to the
[maintenance](831) of law and order and the safeguarding of internal [securities](4646) 

(35)

[child](758) who are suspects or accused persons in [criminal proceedings](5415) should have the right to an individual
[assessment](184) to identify their specific needs in terms of protection, [education](668)  training and [social integration](1469)  to
determine if and to what extent they would need special measures during the [criminal proceedings](5415)  the extent of
their criminal responsibility and the appropriateness of a particular [penalty](3878) or educative measure.

(36)

the individual [assessment](184) should, in particular, take into [account](61) the [child](758) s personality and maturity, the [child](758) s
economic, social and [family](965) background, including living environment, and any specific vulnerabilities of the
[child](758)  such as [learning](5102) disabilities and communication difficulties.

(37)

it should be possible to adapt the extent and detail of an individual [assessment](184) according to the circumstances of
the case, taking into [account](61) the seriousness of the alleged criminal [offence](1432) and the measures that could be taken
if the [child](758) is found guilty of such an [offence](1432)  an individual [assessment](184) which has been carried out with regard
to the same [child](758) in the recent past could be used if it is updated.

(38)

the competent authorities should take [information](1422) deriving from an individual [assessment](184) into [account](61) when
determining whether any specific measure concerning the [child](758) is to be taken, such as providing any practical
assistance; when assessing the appropriateness and effectiveness of any precautionary measures in respect of the
[child](758)  such as [decision](348) on [provision](3446) detention or alternative measures; and, taking [account](61) of the individual
characteristics and circumstances of the [child](758)  when taking any [decision](348) or course of action in the context of the
[criminal proceedings](5415)  including when sentencing. where an individual [assessment](184) is not yet available, this should

l 132/6

en

[Official Journal](1533) of the [euro](665) union

21.5.2016

not prevent the competent authorities from taking such measures or [decision](348)  provided that the conditions set
out in this [directive](448) are complied with, including carrying out an individual [assessment](184) at the earliest appropriate
stage of the proceedings. the appropriateness and effectiveness of the measures or [decision](348) that are taken before
an individual [assessment](184) is carried out could be re-assessed when the individual [assessment](184) becomes available.

the individual [assessment](184) should take place at the earliest appropriate stage of the proceedings and in due time
so that the [information](1422) deriving from it can be taken into [account](61) by the prosecutor, [judge](1537) or another competent
authority, before presentation of the indictment for the purposes of the trial. it should nevertheless be possible to
present an indictment in the absence of an individual [assessment](184) provided that this is in the [child](758) s best [interest](1476) 
this could be the case, for example, where a [child](758) is in pre-trial detention and waiting for the individual
[assessment](184) to become available would risk unnecessarily prolonging such detention.

(40)

member [State](883) should be able to derogate from the obligation to carry out an individual [assessment](184) where such a
derogation is warranted in the circumstances of the case, taking into [account](61)  inter alia, the seriousness of the
alleged criminal [offence](1432) and the measures that could be taken if the [child](758) is found guilty of such an [offence](1432) 
provided that the derogation is compatible with the [child](758) s best [interest](1476)  in that context, all relevant elements
should be taken into consideration, including whether or not the [child](758) has, in the recent past, been the subject of
an individual [assessment](184) in the context of [criminal proceedings](5415) or whether the case concerned may be
conducted without an indictment.

(41)

the duty of care towards [child](758) who are suspects or accused persons underpins a fair administration of justice,
in particular where [child](758) are deprived of liberty and are therefore in a particularly weak position. in order to
ensure the personal integrity of a [child](758) who is deprived of liberty, the [child](758) should have the right to a [medical examination](5307) (925)  such a [medical examination](5307) (925) should be carried out by a physician or another qualified professional,
either on the initiative of the competent authorities, in particular where specific health indications give reasons
for such an [examination](925)  or in response to a request of the [child](758)  of the holder of [parental responsibility](3316) or of
the [child](758) s lawyer. member [State](883) should lay down practical arrangements concerning [medical examination](5307) (925) that
are to be carried out in accordance with this [directive](448)  and concerning access by [child](758) to such [examination](925) 
such arrangements could, inter alia, address situations where two or more requests for [medical examination](5307) (925) are
made in respect of the same [child](758) in a short period of time.

(42)

[child](758) who are suspects or accused persons in [criminal proceedings](5415) are not always able to understand the
content of questioning to which they are subject. in order to ensure sufficient protection of such [child](758) 
questioning by [police](2440) or by other law enforcement authorities should therefore be audio-visually [record](3871) where
it is proportionate to do so, taking into [account](61)  inter alia, whether or not a lawyer is present and whether or not
the [child](758) is deprived of liberty, it being understood that the [child](758) s best [interest](1476) should always be a primary con­
sideration. this [directive](448) does not require member [State](883) to make audiovisual [record](3871) of questioning of
[child](758) by a [judge](1537) or a court.

(43)

where an audiovisual [record](3871) is to be made in accordance with this [directive](448) but an insurmountable technical
problem renders it impossible to make such a [record](3871)  the [police](2440) or other law enforcement authorities should
be able to question the [child](758) without it being audio-visually [record](3871)  provided that reasonable efforts have been
made to overcome the technical problem, that it is not appropriate to postpone the questioning, and that it is
compatible with the [child](758) s best [interest](1476) 

(44)

whether or not the questioning of [child](758) is audio-visually [record](3871)  questioning should in any event be carried
out in a [man](5281) that takes into [account](61) the age and maturity of the [child](758) concerned.

(45)

[child](758) are in a particularly vulnerable position when they are deprived of liberty. special efforts should
therefore be undertaken to avoid deprivation of liberty and, in particular, detention of [child](758) at any stage of
the proceedings before the final determination by a court of the question whether the [child](758) concerned has
committed the criminal [offence](1432)  given the possible risks for their physical, mental and [social development](432)  and
because deprivation of liberty could [lead](2428) to difficulties as regards their reintegration into society. member [State](883) could make practical arrangements, such as [guide](5311) or instructions to [police](2440) officers, on the application of this
requirement to situations of [police](2440) [custody](5296)  in any case, this requirement is without prejudice to the possibility
for [police](2440) officers or other law enforcement authorities to apprehend a [child](758) in situations where it seems, prima
facie, to be necessary to do so, such as in [flag](4103) delicto or immediately after a criminal [offence](1432) has been
committed.

(46)

the competent authorities should always consider measures alternative to detention (alternative measures) and
should have recourse to such measures where possible. such alternative measures could include a prohibition for
the [child](758) to be in certain places, an obligation for the [child](758) to reside in a specific place, restrictions concerning
contact with specific persons, [report](2891) obligations to the competent authorities, participation in [education](668) programmes, or, subject to the [child](758) s consent, participation in [therapeutics](4455) or addiction programmes.

(47)

detention of [child](758) should be subject to periodic review by a court, which could also be a [judge](1537) sitting alone.
it should be possible to carry out such periodic review ex officio by the court, or at the request of the [child](758)  of the
[child](758) s lawyer or of a judicial authority which is not a court, in particular a prosecutor. member [State](883) should
provide for practical arrangements in that respect, including regarding the situation where a periodic review has
already been carried out ex officio by the court and the [child](758) or the [child](758) s lawyer requests that another review be
carried out.

(48)

where [child](758) are detained they should benefit from special protection measures. in particular, they should be
held separately from [adult](160) unless it is considered to be in the [child](758) s best [interest](1476) not to do so, in accordance
with [arts](2688) 37(c) of the [UN convention](201) on the rights of the [child](758)  when a detained [child](758) reaches the age
of 18, it should be possible to continue separate detention where warranted, taking into [account](61) the circum­
stances of the person concerned. particular attention should be paid to the [man](5281) in which detained [child](758) are treated given their inherent vulnerability. [child](758) should have [access to [education](668) (280) facilities according to
their needs.

(49)

member [State](883) should ensure that [child](758) who are suspects or accused persons and kept in [police](2440) [custody](5296) are
held separately from [adult](160)  unless it is considered to be in the [child](758) s best [interest](1476) not to do so, or unless, in
exceptional circumstances, it is not possible in practice to do so, provided that [child](758) are held together with
[adult](160) in a [man](5281) that is compatible with the [child](758) s best [interest](1476)  for example, in sparsely populated areas, it
should be possible, exceptionally, for [child](758) to be held in [police](2440) [custody](5296) with [adult](160)  unless this is contrary to
the [child](758) s best [interest](1476)  in such situations, particular vigilance should be required on the part of competent
authorities in order to protect the [child](758) s physical integrity and well-being.

(50)

it should be possible to detain [child](758) with young [adult](160) unless this is contrary to the [child](758) s best [interest](1476)  it is
for member [State](883) to determine which persons are considered to be young [adult](160) in accordance with their
[national](3521) law and procedures. member [State](883) are encouraged to determine that persons older than 24 years do
not qualify as young [adult](160) 

(51)

where [child](758) are detained, member [State](883) should take appropriate measures as set out in this [directive](448)  such
measures should, inter alia, ensure the effective and regular exercise of the right to [family](965) life. [child](758) should
have the right to maintain regular contact with their parents, [family](965) and friends through visits and correspon­
dence, unless exceptional restrictions are required in the [child](758) s best [interest](1476) or in the [interest](1476) of justice.

(52)

member [State](883) should also take appropriate measures to ensure respect for the freedom of [religion](3257) or belief of
the [child](758)  in that regard, member [State](883) should, in particular, refrain from interfering with the [religion](3257) or belief of
the [child](758)  member [State](883) are not, however, required to take active steps to assist [child](758) in worshipping.

(53)

where appropriate, member [State](883) should also take appropriate measures in other situations of deprivation of
liberty. the measures taken should be proportionate and appropriate to the nature of the deprivation of liberty,
such as [police](2440) [custody](5296) or detention, and to its duration.

(54)

professionals in direct contact with [child](758) should take into [account](61) the particular needs of [child](758) of different
age groups and should ensure that the proceedings are adapted to them. for those purposes, those professionals
should be specially trained in dealing with [child](758) 

(55)

[child](758) should be treated in a [man](5281) appropriate to their age, maturity and level of understanding, taking into
[account](61) any special needs, including any communication difficulties, that they may have.

(56)

taking into [account](61) the differences between the legal traditions and systems across the member [State](883)  the
privacy of [child](758) during [criminal proceedings](5415) should be ensured in the best possible way with a view, inter alia,
to facilitating the reintegration of [child](758) into society. member [State](883) should provide that court hearings
involving [child](758) are usually held in the absence of the public, or allow courts or [judge](1537) to decide to hold such
hearings in the absence of the public. this is without prejudice to judgments being pronounced publicly in
accordance with [arts](2688) 6 echr.

(57)

[child](758) should have the right to be accompanied by the holder of [parental responsibility](3316) during court hearings
in which they are involved. if more than one person holds [parental responsibility](3316) for the same [child](758)  the [child](758) should have the right to be accompanied by all of them, unless this is not possible in practice despite the
competent authorities' reasonable efforts. member [State](883) should lay down practical arrangements for the exercise
by [child](758) of the right to be accompanied by the holder of [parental responsibility](3316) during court hearings in
which they are involved and concerning the conditions under which an accompanying person may be
temporarily excluded from court hearings. such arrangements could, inter alia, address the situation where the
holder of [parental responsibility](3316) is temporarily not available to accompany the [child](758) or where the holder does
not want to make use of the possibility to accompany the [child](758)  provided that the [child](758) s best [interest](1476) are taken
into [account](61) 

(58)

in certain circumstances, which can also relate to only one of the persons holding [parental responsibility](3316)  the
[child](758) should have the right to be accompanied during court hearings by an appropriate [adult](160) other than the
holder of [parental responsibility](3316)  one of those circumstances is where the holder of [parental responsibility](3316) accompanying the [child](758) could substantially jeopardise the [criminal proceedings](5415)  in particular where objective and
factual circumstances indicate or give rise to the suspicion that [evidence](4434) may be destroyed or altered, witnesses
may be interfered with, or the holder of [parental responsibility](3316) may have been involved with the [child](758) in the
alleged criminal activity.

(59)

in accordance with this [directive](448)  [child](758) should also have the right to be accompanied by the holder of
[parental responsibility](3316) during other stages of the proceedings at which they are present, such as during [police](2440) questioning.

(60)

the right of an accused person to appear in person at the trial is based on the right to a fair trial provided for in
[arts](2688) 47 of the charter and in [arts](2688) 6 echr, as interpreted by the court of justice and by the [euro](665) court of [human rights](584)  member [State](883) should take appropriate measures to provide incentives for [child](758) to
attend their trial, including by summoning them in person and by sending a copy of the summons to the holder
of [parental responsibility](3316) or, where that would be contrary to the [child](758) s best [interest](1476)  to another appropriate
[adult](160)  member [State](883) should provide for practical arrangements regarding the presence of a [child](758) at the trial.
those arrangements could include [provision](3446) concerning the conditions under which a [child](758) can be temporarily
excluded from the trial.

(61)

certain rights provided for by this [directive](448) should apply to [child](758) who are requested persons from the time
when they are [arrest](3970) in the executing member [State](883) 

(62)

the [euro](665) [arrest](3970) [war](1210) proceedings are crucial for cooperation between the member [State](883) in criminal
matters. compliance with the time-limits contained in [framework decision](7194) (348) 2002/584/jha is essential for such
cooperation. therefore, while [child](758) who are requested persons should be able to exercise their rights fully
under this [directive](448) in [euro](665) [arrest](3970) [war](1210) proceedings, those time-limits should be complied with.

(63)

member [State](883) should take appropriate measures to ensure that [judge](1537) and prosecutors who deal with [criminal proceedings](5415) involving [child](758) have specific competence in that field or have effective access to specific training,
in particular with regard to [child](758) s rights, appropriate questioning techniques, [child](758) [psychology](2856)  and communi­
cation in a [language](1580) adapted to [child](758)  member [State](883) should also take appropriate measures to promote the
[provision](3446) of such specific training to lawyers who deal with [criminal proceedings](5415) involving [child](758) 

(64)

in order to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of this [directive](448)  there is a need for collection of relevant data,
from available data, with regard to the implementation of the rights set out in this [directive](448)  such data include
data [record](3871) by the judicial authorities and by law enforcement authorities and, as far as possible, administrative
data compiled by healthcare and [social services](4143) (4099) as regards the rights set out in this [directive](448)  in particular
in relation to the number of [child](758) given access to a lawyer, the number of individual [assessment](184) carried out,
the number of audiovisual [record](3871) of questioning and the number of [child](758) deprived of liberty.

member [State](883) should respect and [guarantee](1129) the rights set out in this [directive](448)  without any discrimination based
on any ground such as race, colour, sex, sexual orientation, [language](1580)  [religion](3257)  political or other [opinion](4449) 
[national](3521)  ethnic or social origin, property, disability or [births](2029) 

(66)

this [directive](448) upholds the fundamental rights and principles as recognised by the charter and by the echr,
including the prohibition of [torture](4467) and inhuman or degrading treatment, the right to liberty and [securities](4646) 
respect for private and [family](965) life, the right to the integrity of the person, the rights of the [child](758)  the integration
of persons with disabilities, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, the presumption of innocence, and
the [rights of the defence](3974)  this [directive](448) should be implemented in accordance with those rights and principles.

(67)

this [directive](448) lays down minimum rules. member [State](883) should be able to extend the rights laid down in this
[directive](448) in order to provide a higher level of protection. such higher level of protection should not constitute an
obstacle to the mutual recognition of judicial [decision](348) that those minimum rules are designed to facilitate. the
level of protection provided for by member [State](883) should never fall below the [standard](2077) provided by the charter
or the echr, as interpreted by the court of justice and by the [euro](665) court of [human rights](584) 

(68)

since the objectives of this [directive](448)  namely setting common minimum [standard](2077) on procedural safeguards for
[child](758) who are suspects or accused persons in [criminal proceedings](5415)  cannot be sufficiently achieved by the
member [State](883)  but can rather, by reason of its scale and effect, be better achieved at union level, the union may
adopt measures in accordance with the [principle of subsidiarity](5812) as set out in [arts](2688) 5 teu. in accordance with
the [principle of proportionality](6133) as set out in that [arts](2688)  this [directive](448) does not go beyond what is necessary in
order to achieve those objectives.
